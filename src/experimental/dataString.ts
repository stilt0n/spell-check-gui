<s> chapter i
<s> my father s family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than pip
<s> so i called myself pip and came to be called pip
<s> i give pirrip as my father s family name on the authority of his tombstone and my sister mrs
<s> joe gargery who married the blacksmith
<s> as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of either of them for their days were long before the days of photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones
<s> the shape of the letters on my father s gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man with curly black hair
<s> from the character and turn of the inscription also georgiana wife of the above i drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly
<s> to five little stone lozenges each about a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle i am indebted for a belief i religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers pockets and had never taken them out in this state of existence
<s> ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river wound twenty miles of the sea
<s> my first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening
<s> at such a time i found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and that philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that alexander bartholomew abraham tobias and roger infant children of the aforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gates with scattered cattle feeding on it was the marshes and that the low leaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was pip
<s> hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch
<s> keep still you little devil or i ll cut your throat
<s> a fearful man all in coarse grey with a great iron on his leg
<s> a man with no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his head
<s> a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin
<s> oh don t cut my throat sir i pleaded in terror
<s> pray don t do it sir
<s> tell us your name said the man
<s> quick
<s> pip sir
<s> once more said the man staring at me
<s> give it mouth
<s> pip
<s> pip sir
<s> show us where you live said the man
<s> pint out the place
<s> i pointed to where our village lay on the flat in shore among the alder trees and pollards a mile or more from the church
<s> the man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and emptied my pockets
<s> there was nothing in them but a piece of bread
<s> when the church came to itself for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my feet when the church came to itself i say i was seated on a high tombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously
<s> 0037m
<s> you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you ha got
<s> i believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my years and not strong
<s> darn me if i couldn t eat em said the man with a threatening shake of his head and if i han t half a mind to t
<s> i earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn t and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it partly to keep myself from crying
<s> now lookee here said the man
<s> where s your mother
<s> there sir said i
<s> he started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder
<s> there sir i timidly explained
<s> also georgiana
<s> that s my mother
<s> oh said he coming back
<s> and is that your father alonger your mother
<s> yes sir said i him too late of this parish
<s> ha he muttered then considering
<s> who d ye live with supposin you re kindly let to live which i han t made up my mind about
<s> my sister sir mrs
<s> joe gargery wife of joe gargery the blacksmith sir
<s> blacksmith eh said he
<s> and looked down at his leg
<s> after darkly looking at his leg and me several times he came closer to my tombstone took me by both arms and tilted me back as far as he could hold me so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine and mine looked most helplessly up into his
<s> now lookee here he said the question being whether you re to be let to live
<s> you know what a file is
<s> yes sir
<s> and you know what wittles is
<s> yes sir
<s> after each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger
<s> you get me a file
<s> he tilted me again
<s> and you get me wittles
<s> he tilted me again
<s> you bring em both to me
<s> he tilted me again
<s> or i ll have your heart and liver out
<s> he tilted me again
<s> i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both hands and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright sir perhaps i shouldn t be sick and perhaps i could attend more
<s> he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped over its own weathercock
<s> then he held me by the arms in an upright position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms
<s> you bring me to morrow morning early that file and them wittles
<s> you bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder
<s> you do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live
<s> you fail or you go from my words in any partickler no matter how small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted and ate
<s> now i ain t alone as you may think i am
<s> there s a young man hid with me in comparison with which young man i am a angel
<s> that young man hears the words i speak
<s> that young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself of getting at a boy and at his heart and at his liver
<s> it is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man
<s> a boy may lock his door may be warm in bed may tuck himself up may draw the clothes over his head may think himself comfortable and safe but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open
<s> i am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment with great difficulty
<s> i find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside
<s> now what do you say
<s> i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in the morning
<s> say lord strike you dead if you don t said the man
<s> i said so and he took me down
<s> now he pursued you remember what you ve undertook and you remember that young man and you get home
<s> goo good night sir i faltered
<s> much of that said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat
<s> i wish i was a frog
<s> or a eel
<s> at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms clasping himself as if to hold himself together and limped towards the low church wall
<s> as i saw him go picking his way among the nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in
<s> when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me
<s> when i saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of my legs
<s> but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on again towards the river still hugging himself in both arms and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there for stepping places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in
<s> the marshes were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed
<s> on the edge of the river i could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered like an unhooped cask upon a pole an ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate
<s> the man was limping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come down and going back to hook himself up again
<s> it gave me a terrible turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too
<s> i looked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him
<s> but now i was frightened again and ran home without stopping
<s> chapter ii
<s> my sister mrs
<s> joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up by hand
<s> having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand
<s> she was not a good looking woman my sister and i had a general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by hand
<s> joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites
<s> he was a mild good natured sweet tempered easy going foolish dear fellow a sort of hercules in strength and also in weakness
<s> my sister mrs
<s> joe with black hair and eyes had such a prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg grater instead of soap
<s> she was tall and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles
<s> she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much
<s> though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life
<s> joe s forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our country were most of them at that time
<s> when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen
<s> joe and i being fellow sufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner
<s> mrs
<s> joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip
<s> and she s out now making it a baker s dozen
<s> is she
<s> yes pip said joe and what s worse she s got tickler with her
<s> at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire
<s> tickler was a wax ended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame
<s> she sot down said joe and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she ram paged out
<s> that s what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it she ram paged out pip
<s> has she been gone long joe i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal
<s> well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock she s been on the ram page this last spell about five minutes pip
<s> she s a coming get behind the door old chap and have the jack towel betwixt you
<s> i took the advice
<s> my sister mrs
<s> joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation
<s> she concluded by throwing me i often served as a connubial missile at joe who glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg
<s> where have you been you young monkey said mrs
<s> joe stamping her foot
<s> tell me directly what you ve been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit or i d have you out of that corner if you was fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys
<s> i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and rubbing myself
<s> churchyard repeated my sister
<s> if it warn t for me you d have been to the churchyard long ago and stayed there
<s> who brought you up by hand
<s> you did said i
<s> and why did i do it i should like to know exclaimed my sister
<s> i whimpered i don t know
<s> i don t said my sister
<s> i d never do it again i know that
<s> i may truly say i ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were
<s> it s bad enough to be a blacksmith s wife and him a gargery without being your mother
<s> my thoughts strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at the fire
<s> for the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg the mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge i was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me in the avenging coals
<s> hah said mrs
<s> joe restoring tickler to his station
<s> churchyard indeed you may well say churchyard you two
<s> one of us by the by had not said it at all
<s> you ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one of these days and o a pr r recious pair you d be without me
<s> as she applied herself to set the tea things joe peeped down at me over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed
<s> after that he sat feeling his right side flaxen curls and whisker and following mrs
<s> joe about with his blue eyes as his manner always was at squally times
<s> my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us that never varied
<s> first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib where it sometimes got a pin into it and sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths
<s> then she took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf in an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plaster using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust
<s> then she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into two halves of which joe got one and i the other
<s> on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my slice
<s> i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man
<s> i knew mrs
<s> joe s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe
<s> therefore i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers
<s> the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i found to be quite awful
<s> it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water
<s> and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious joe
<s> in our already mentioned freemasonry as fellow sufferers and in his good natured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each other s admiration now and then which stimulated us to new exertions
<s> to night joe several times invited me by the display of his fast diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition but he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and my untouched bread and butter on the other
<s> at last i desperately considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances
<s> i took advantage of a moment when joe had just looked at me and got my bread and butter down my leg
<s> joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he didn t seem to enjoy
<s> he turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like a pill
<s> he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw that my bread and butter was gone
<s> the wonder and consternation with which joe stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sister s observation
<s> what s the matter now said she smartly as she put down her cup
<s> i say you know muttered joe shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance
<s> pip old chap you ll do yourself a mischief
<s> it ll stick somewhere
<s> you can t have chawed it pip
<s> what s the matter now repeated my sister more sharply than before
<s> if you can cough any trifle on it up pip i d recommend you to do it said joe all aghast
<s> manners is manners but still your elth s your elth
<s> by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on joe and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily on
<s> now perhaps you ll mention what s the matter said my sister out of breath you staring great stuck pig
<s> joe looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and looked at me again
<s> you know pip said joe solemnly with his last bite in his cheek and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone you and me is always friends and i d be the last to tell upon you any time
<s> but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us and then again at me such a most oncommon bolt as that
<s> been bolting his food has he cried my sister
<s> you know old chap said joe looking at me and not at mrs
<s> joe with his bite still in his cheek i bolted myself when i was your age frequent and as a boy i ve been among a many bolters but i never see your bolting equal yet pip and it s a mercy you ain t bolted dead
<s> my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying nothing more than the awful words you come along and be dosed
<s> some medical beast had revived tar water in those days as a fine medicine and mrs
<s> joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness
<s> at the best of times so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new fence
<s> on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater comfort while mrs
<s> joe held my head under her arm as a boot would be held in a bootjack
<s> joe got off with half a pint but was made to swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire because he had had a turn
<s> judging from myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had none before
<s> conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when in the case of a boy that secret burden co operates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great punishment
<s> the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob mrs
<s> joe i never thought i was going to rob joe for i never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind
<s> then as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy declaring that he couldn t and wouldn t starve until to morrow but must be fed now
<s> at other times i thought what if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to night instead of to morrow if ever anybody s hair stood on end with terror mine must have done so then
<s> but perhaps nobody s ever did
<s> it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with a copper stick from seven to eight by the dutch clock
<s> i tried it with the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable
<s> happily i slipped away and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom
<s> hark said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed was that great guns joe
<s> ah said joe
<s> there s another conwict off
<s> what does that mean joe said i
<s> mrs
<s> joe who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly escaped
<s> escaped
<s> administering the definition like tar water
<s> while mrs
<s> joe sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my mouth into the forms of saying to joe what s a convict joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i could make out nothing of it but the single word pip
<s> there was a conwict off last night said joe aloud after sunset gun
<s> and they fired warning of him
<s> and now it appears they re firing warning of another
<s> who s firing said i
<s> drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work what a questioner he is
<s> ask no questions and you ll be told no lies
<s> it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be told lies by her even if i did ask questions
<s> but she never was polite unless there was company
<s> at this point joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like sulks
<s> therefore i naturally pointed to mrs
<s> joe and put my mouth into the form of saying her but joe wouldn t hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it
<s> but i could make nothing of the word
<s> mrs
<s> joe said i as a last resort i should like to know if you wouldn t much mind where the firing comes from
<s> lord bless the boy exclaimed my sister as if she didn t quite mean that but rather the contrary
<s> from the hulks
<s> oh h said i looking at joe
<s> hulks
<s> joe gave a reproachful cough as much as to say well i told you so
<s> and please what s hulks said i
<s> that s the way with this boy exclaimed my sister pointing me out with her needle and thread and shaking her head at me
<s> answer him one question and he ll ask you a dozen directly
<s> hulks are prison ships right cross th meshes
<s> we always used that name for marshes in our country
<s> i wonder who s put into prison ships and why they re put there said i in a general way and with quiet desperation
<s> it was too much for mrs
<s> joe who immediately rose
<s> i tell you what young fellow said she i didn t bring you up by hand to badger people s lives out
<s> it would be blame to me and not praise if i had
<s> people are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob and forge and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking questions
<s> now you get along to bed
<s> i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went upstairs in the dark with my head tingling from mrs
<s> joe s thimble having played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last words i felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me
<s> i was clearly on my way there
<s> i had begun by asking questions and i was going to rob mrs
<s> joe
<s> since that time which is far enough away now i have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror
<s> no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror
<s> i was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver i was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg i was in mortal terror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted i had no hope of deliverance through my all powerful sister who repulsed me at every turn i am afraid to think of what i might have done on requirement in the secrecy of my terror
<s> if i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong spring tide to the hulks a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speaking trumpet as i passed the gibbet station that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at once and not put it off
<s> i was afraid to sleep even if i had been inclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob the pantry
<s> there was no doing it in the night for there was no getting a light by easy friction then to have got one i must have struck it out of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains
<s> as soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with grey i got up and went downstairs every board upon the way and every crack in every board calling after me stop thief and get up mrs
<s> joe in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied than usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back was half turned winking
<s> i had no time for verification no time for selection no time for anything for i had no time to spare
<s> i stole some bread some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i tied up in my pocket handkerchief with my last night s slice some brandy from a stone bottle which i decanted into a glass bottle i had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid spanish liquorice water up in my room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard a meat bone with very little on it and a beautiful round compact pork pie
<s> i was nearly going away without the pie but i was tempted to mount upon a shelf to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner and i found it was the pie and i took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use and would not be missed for some time
<s> there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge i unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among joe s tools
<s> then i put the fastenings as i had found them opened the door at which i had entered when i ran home last night shut it and ran for the misty marshes
<s> chapter iii
<s> it was a rimy morning and very damp
<s> i had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all night and using the window for a pocket handkerchief
<s> now i saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of spiders webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade
<s> on every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village a direction which they never accepted for they never came there was invisible to me until i was quite close under it
<s> then as i looked up at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the hulks
<s> the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marshes so that instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me
<s> this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind
<s> the gates and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly as could be a boy with somebody else s pork pie stop him the cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eyes and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief one black ox with a white cravat on who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air fixed me so obstinately with his eyes and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved round that i blubbered out to him i couldn t help it sir it wasn t for myself i took it upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kick up of his hind legs and a flourish of his tail
<s> all this time i was getting on towards the river but however fast i went i couldn t warm my feet to which the damp cold seemed riveted as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet
<s> i knew my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a sunday with joe and joe sitting on an old gun had told me that when i was prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to the right and consequently had to try back along the river side on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out
<s> making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me
<s> his back was towards me and he had his arms folded and was nodding forward heavy with sleep
<s> i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder
<s> he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but another man
<s> and yet this man was dressed in coarse grey too and had a great iron on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that the other man was except that he had not the same face and had a flat broad brimmed low crowned felt hat on
<s> all this i saw in a moment for i had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me made a hit at me it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down for it made him stumble and then he ran into the mist stumbling twice as he went and i lost him
<s> it s the young man i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified him
<s> i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had known where it was
<s> i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right man hugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping waiting for me
<s> he was awfully cold to be sure
<s> i half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold
<s> his eyes looked so awfully hungry too that when i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle
<s> he did not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pockets
<s> what s in the bottle boy said he
<s> brandy said i
<s> he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry than a man who was eating it but he left off to take some of the liquor
<s> he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth without biting it off
<s> i think you have got the ague said i
<s> i m much of your opinion boy said he
<s> it s bad about here i told him
<s> you ve been lying out on the meshes and they re dreadful aguish
<s> rheumatic too
<s> i ll eat my breakfast afore they re the death of me said he
<s> i d do that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there directly afterwards
<s> i ll beat the shivers so far i ll bet you
<s> he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us and often stopping even stopping his jaws to listen
<s> some real or fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly
<s> you re not a deceiving imp you brought no one with you
<s> no sir no
<s> nor giv no one the office to follow you
<s> no
<s> well said he i believe you
<s> you d be but a fierce young hound indeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is
<s> something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock and was going to strike
<s> and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes
<s> pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it
<s> did you speak
<s> i said i was glad you enjoyed it
<s> thankee my boy
<s> i do
<s> i had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and i now noticed a decided similarity between the dog s way of eating and the man s
<s> the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog
<s> he swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought there was danger in every direction of somebody s coming to take the pie away
<s> he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor
<s> in all of which particulars he was very like the dog
<s> i am afraid you won t leave any of it for him said i timidly after a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark
<s> there s no more to be got where that came from
<s> it was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint
<s> leave any for him who s him said my friend stopping in his crunching of pie crust
<s> the young man
<s> that you spoke of
<s> that was hid with you
<s> oh ah he returned with something like a gruff laugh
<s> him yes yes he don t want no wittles
<s> i thought he looked as if he did said i
<s> the man stopped eating and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise
<s> looked when
<s> just now
<s> where
<s> yonder said i pointing over there where i found him nodding asleep and thought it was you
<s> he held me by the collar and stared at me so that i began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived
<s> dressed like you you know only with a hat i explained trembling and and i was very anxious to put this delicately and with the same reason for wanting to borrow a file
<s> didn t you hear the cannon last night
<s> then there was firing he said to himself
<s> i wonder you shouldn t have been sure of that i returned for we heard it up at home and that s farther away and we were shut in besides
<s> why see now said he
<s> when a man s alone on these flats with a light head and a light stomach perishing of cold and want he hears nothin all night but guns firing and voices calling
<s> hears he sees the soldiers with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore closing in round him
<s> hears his number called hears himself challenged hears the rattle of the muskets hears the orders make ready present cover him steady men and is laid hands on and there s nothin why if i see one pursuing party last night coming up in order damn em with their tramp tramp i see a hundred
<s> and as to firing why i see the mist shake with the cannon arter it was broad day but this man he had said all the rest as if he had forgotten my being there did you notice anything in him
<s> he had a badly bruised face said i recalling what i hardly knew i knew
<s> not here exclaimed the man striking his left cheek mercilessly with the flat of his hand
<s> yes there
<s> where is he he crammed what little food was left into the breast of his grey jacket
<s> show me the way he went
<s> i ll pull him down like a bloodhound
<s> curse this iron on my sore leg give us hold of the file boy
<s> i indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man and he looked up at it for an instant
<s> but he was down on the rank wet grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file
<s> i was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer
<s> i told him i must go but he took no notice so i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off
<s> the last i saw of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg
<s> the last i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still going
<s> chapter iv
<s> i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me up
<s> but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery
<s> mrs
<s> joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day and joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust pan an article into which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment
<s> and where the deuce ha you been was mrs
<s> joe s christmas salutation when i and my conscience showed ourselves
<s> i said i had been down to hear the carols
<s> ah well observed mrs
<s> joe
<s> you might ha done worse
<s> not a doubt of that i thought
<s> perhaps if i warn t a blacksmith s wife and what s the same thing a slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols said mrs
<s> joe
<s> i m rather partial to carols myself and that s the best of reasons for my never hearing any
<s> joe who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air when mrs
<s> joe darted a look at him and when her eyes were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them to me as our token that mrs
<s> joe was in a cross temper
<s> this was so much her normal state that joe and i would often for weeks together be as to our fingers like monumental crusaders as to their legs
<s> we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls
<s> a handsome mince pie had been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed and the pudding was already on the boil
<s> these extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast for i ain t said mrs
<s> joe i ain t a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what i ve got before me i promise you
<s> so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of milk and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser
<s> in the meantime mrs
<s> joe put clean white curtains up and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage which was never uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel shelf each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other
<s> mrs
<s> joe was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself
<s> cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by their religion
<s> my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that is to say joe and i were going
<s> in his working clothes joe was a well knit characteristic looking blacksmith in his holiday clothes he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances than anything else
<s> nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and everything that he wore then grazed him
<s> on the present festive occasion he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials
<s> as to me i think my sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law
<s> i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends
<s> even when i was taken to have a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs
<s> joe and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds
<s> yet what i suffered outside was nothing to what i underwent within
<s> the terrors that had assailed me whenever mrs
<s> joe had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done
<s> under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment
<s> i conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said ye are now to declare it would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry
<s> i am far from being sure that i might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday
<s> mr
<s> wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us and mr
<s> hubble the wheelwright and mrs
<s> hubble and uncle pumblechook joe s uncle but mrs
<s> joe appropriated him who was a well to do cornchandler in the nearest town and drove his own chaise cart
<s> the dinner hour was half past one
<s> when joe and i got home we found the table laid and mrs
<s> joe dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked it never was at any other time for the company to enter by and everything most splendid
<s> and still not a word of the robbery
<s> the time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and the company came
<s> mr
<s> wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head he would read the clergyman into fits he himself confessed that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would not despair of making his mark in it
<s> the church not being thrown open he was as i have said our clerk
<s> but he punished the amens tremendously and when he gave out the psalm always giving the whole verse he looked all round the congregation first as much as to say you have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this style
<s> i opened the door to the company making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door and i opened it first to mr
<s> wopsle next to mr
<s> and mrs
<s> hubble and last of all to uncle pumblechook
<s> n
<s> b
<s> i was not allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties
<s> mrs
<s> joe said uncle pumblechook a large hard breathing middle aged slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eyes and sandy hair standing upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the compliments of the season i have brought you mum a bottle of sherry wine and i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine
<s> every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with exactly the same words and carrying the two bottles like dumb bells
<s> every christmas day mrs
<s> joe replied as she now replied o un cle pum ble chook this is kind every christmas day he retorted as he now retorted it s no more than your merits
<s> and now are you all bobbish and how s sixpennorth of halfpence meaning me
<s> we dined on these occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlour which was a change very like joe s change from his working clothes to his sunday dress
<s> my sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of mrs
<s> hubble than in other company
<s> i remember mrs
<s> hubble as a little curly sharp edged person in sky blue who held a conventionally juvenile position because she had married mr
<s> hubble i don t know at what remote period when she was much younger than he
<s> i remember mr hubble as a tough high shouldered stooping old man of a sawdusty fragrance with his legs extraordinarily wide apart so that in my short days i always saw some miles of open country between them when i met him coming up the lane
<s> among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadn t robbed the pantry in a false position
<s> not because i was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak i didn t want to speak nor because i was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig when living had had the least reason to be vain
<s> no i should not have minded that if they would only have left me alone
<s> but they wouldn t leave me alone
<s> they seemed to think the opportunity lost if they failed to point the conversation at me every now and then and stick the point into me
<s> i might have been an unfortunate little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads
<s> it began the moment we sat down to dinner
<s> mr
<s> wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation as it now appears to me something like a religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the third and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful
<s> upon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low reproachful voice do you hear that be grateful
<s> especially said mr
<s> pumblechook be grateful boy to them which brought you up by hand
<s> mrs
<s> hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that i should come to no good asked why is it that the young are never grateful this moral mystery seemed too much for the company until mr
<s> hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally wicious
<s> everybody then murmured true and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner
<s> joe s station and influence were something feebler if possible when there was company than when there was none
<s> but he always aided and comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so at dinner time by giving me gravy if there were any
<s> there being plenty of gravy to day joe spooned into my plate at this point about half a pint
<s> a little later on in the dinner mr
<s> wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity and intimated in the usual hypothetical case of the church being thrown open what kind of sermon he would have given them
<s> after favouring them with some heads of that discourse he remarked that he considered the subject of the day s homily ill chosen which was the less excusable he added when there were so many subjects going about
<s> true again said uncle pumblechook
<s> you ve hit it sir plenty of subjects going about for them that know how to put salt upon their tails
<s> that s what s wanted
<s> a man needn t go far to find a subject if he s ready with his salt box
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook added after a short interval of reflection look at pork alone
<s> there s a subject if you want a subject look at pork
<s> true sir
<s> many a moral for the young returned mr
<s> wopsle and i knew he was going to lug me in before he said it might be deduced from that text
<s> you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis
<s> joe gave me some more gravy
<s> swine pursued mr
<s> wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian name swine were the companions of the prodigal
<s> the gluttony of swine is put before us as an example to the young
<s> i thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy
<s> what is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy
<s> or girl suggested mr
<s> hubble
<s> of course or girl mr
<s> hubble assented mr
<s> wopsle rather irritably but there is no girl present
<s> besides said mr
<s> pumblechook turning sharp on me think what you ve got to be grateful for
<s> if you d been born a squeaker
<s> he was if ever a child was said my sister most emphatically
<s> joe gave me some more gravy
<s> well but i mean a four footed squeaker said mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> if you had been born such would you have been here now not you
<s> unless in that form said mr
<s> wopsle nodding towards the dish
<s> but i don t mean in that form sir returned mr
<s> pumblechook who had an objection to being interrupted i mean enjoying himself with his elders and betters and improving himself with their conversation and rolling in the lap of luxury
<s> would he have been doing that no he wouldn t
<s> and what would have been your destination turning on me again
<s> you would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article and dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped you under his left arm and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat pocket and he would have shed your blood and had your life
<s> no bringing up by hand then
<s> not a bit of it
<s> joe offered me more gravy which i was afraid to take
<s> he was a world of trouble to you ma am said mrs
<s> hubble commiserating my sister
<s> trouble echoed my sister trouble and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts of sleeplessness i had committed and all the high places i had tumbled from and all the low places i had tumbled into and all the injuries i had done myself and all the times she had wished me in my grave and i had contumaciously refused to go there
<s> i think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with their noses
<s> perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence
<s> anyhow mr
<s> wopsle s roman nose so aggravated me during the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it until he howled
<s> but all i had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister s recital and in which pause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully conscious with indignation and abhorrence
<s> yet said mr
<s> pumblechook leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed pork regarded as biled is rich too ain t it
<s> have a little brandy uncle said my sister
<s> o heavens it had come at last he would find it was weak he would say it was weak and i was lost i held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth with both hands and awaited my fate
<s> my sister went for the stone bottle came back with the stone bottle and poured his brandy out no one else taking any
<s> the wretched man trifled with his glass took it up looked at it through the light put it down prolonged my misery
<s> all this time mrs
<s> joe and joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding
<s> i couldn t keep my eyes off him
<s> always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet i saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink the brandy off
<s> instantly afterwards the company were seized with unspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his feet turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping cough dance and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window violently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous faces and apparently out of his mind
<s> i held on tight while mrs
<s> joe and joe ran to him
<s> i didn t know how i had done it but i had no doubt i had murdered him somehow
<s> in my dreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp tar
<s> i had filled up the bottle from the tar water jug
<s> i knew he would be worse by and by
<s> i moved the table like a medium of the present day by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it
<s> tar cried my sister in amazement
<s> why how ever could tar come there
<s> but uncle pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldn t hear the word wouldn t hear of the subject imperiously waved it all away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water
<s> my sister who had begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemon peel and mixing them
<s> for the time being at least i was saved
<s> i still held on to the leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude
<s> by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook partook of pudding
<s> all partook of pudding
<s> the course terminated and mr
<s> pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water
<s> i began to think i should get over the day when my sister said to joe clean plates cold
<s> i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul
<s> i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was gone
<s> you must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best grace you must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious present of uncle pumblechook s
<s> must they let them not hope to taste it
<s> you must know said my sister rising it s a pie a savory pork pie
<s> the company murmured their compliments
<s> uncle pumblechook sensible of having deserved well of his fellow creatures said quite vivaciously all things considered well mrs
<s> joe we ll do our best endeavours let us have a cut at this same pie
<s> my sister went out to get it
<s> i heard her steps proceed to the pantry
<s> i saw mr
<s> pumblechook balance his knife
<s> i saw reawakening appetite in the roman nostrils of mr
<s> wopsle
<s> i heard mr
<s> hubble remark that a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do no harm and i heard joe say you shall have some pip
<s> i have never been absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror merely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company
<s> i felt that i could bear no more and that i must run away
<s> i released the leg of the table and ran for my life
<s> but i ran no farther than the house door for there i ran head foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me saying here you are look sharp come on
<s> chapter v
<s> the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but ends of their loaded muskets on our door step caused the dinner party to rise from table in confusion and caused mrs
<s> joe re entering the kitchen empty handed to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of gracious goodness gracious me what s gone with the pie
<s> the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when mrs
<s> joe stood staring at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses
<s> it was the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand and his left on my shoulder
<s> excuse me ladies and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadn t i am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith
<s> and pray what might you want with him retorted my sister quick to resent his being wanted at all
<s> missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should reply the honour and pleasure of his fine wife s acquaintance speaking for the king i answer a little job done
<s> this was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that mr
<s> pumblechook cried audibly good again
<s> you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked out joe with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find the lock of one of em goes wrong and the coupling don t act pretty
<s> as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over them
<s> joe threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer two hours than one
<s> will it then will you set about it at once blacksmith said the off hand sergeant as it s on his majesty s service
<s> and if my men can bear a hand anywhere they ll make themselves useful
<s> with that he called to his men who came trooping into the kitchen one after another and piled their arms in a corner
<s> and then they stood about as soldiers do now with their hands loosely clasped before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now easing a belt or a pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out into the yard
<s> all these things i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i was in an agony of apprehension
<s> but beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little more of my scattered wits
<s> would you give me the time said the sergeant addressing himself to mr
<s> pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time
<s> it s just gone half past two
<s> that s not so bad said the sergeant reflecting even if i was forced to halt here nigh two hours that ll do
<s> how far might you call yourselves from the marshes hereabouts not above a mile i reckon
<s> just a mile said mrs
<s> joe
<s> that ll do
<s> we begin to close in upon em about dusk
<s> a little before dusk my orders are
<s> that ll do
<s> convicts sergeant asked mr
<s> wopsle in a matter of course way
<s> ay returned the sergeant two
<s> they re pretty well known to be out on the marshes still and they won t try to get clear of em before dusk
<s> anybody here seen anything of any such game
<s> everybody myself excepted said no with confidence
<s> nobody thought of me
<s> well said the sergeant they ll find themselves trapped in a circle i expect sooner than they count on
<s> now blacksmith if you re ready his majesty the king is
<s> joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron on and passed into the forge
<s> one of the soldiers opened its wooden windows another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring
<s> then joe began to hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on
<s> the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention but even made my sister liberal
<s> she drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy
<s> but mr
<s> pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum
<s> i ll engage there s no tar in that so the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it was equally convenient
<s> when it was given him he drank his majesty s health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips
<s> good stuff eh sergeant said mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> i ll tell you something returned the sergeant i suspect that stuff s of your providing
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay why
<s> because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder you re a man that knows what s what
<s> d ye think so said mr
<s> pumblechook with his former laugh
<s> have another glass
<s> with you
<s> hob and nob returned the sergeant
<s> the top of mine to the foot of yours the foot of yours to the top of mine ring once ring twice the best tune on the musical glasses your health
<s> may you live a thousand years and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life
<s> the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass
<s> i noticed that mr
<s> pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the bottle from mrs
<s> joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality
<s> even i got some
<s> and he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the same liberality when the first was gone
<s> as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was
<s> they had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished
<s> and now when they were all in lively anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them joe to hammer and clink for them and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the red hot sparks dropped and died the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account poor wretches
<s> at last joe s job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped
<s> as joe got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook and mr
<s> hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and ladies society but mr
<s> wopsle said he would go if joe would
<s> joe said he was agreeable and would take me if mrs
<s> joe approved
<s> we never should have got leave to go i am sure but for mrs
<s> joe s curiosity to know all about it and how it ended
<s> as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket don t look to me to put it together again
<s> the sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies and parted from mr
<s> pumblechook as from a comrade though i doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman s merits under arid conditions as when something moist was going
<s> his men resumed their muskets and fell in
<s> mr
<s> wopsle joe and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and to speak no word after we reached the marshes
<s> when we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably whispered to joe i hope joe we shan t find them
<s> and joe whispered to me i d give a shilling if they had cut and run pip
<s> we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming on and the people had good fires in doors and were keeping the day
<s> a few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us but none came out
<s> we passed the finger post and held straight on to the churchyard
<s> there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant s hand while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves and also examined the porch
<s> they came in again without finding anything and then we struck out on the open marshes through the gate at the side of the churchyard
<s> a bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind and joe took me on his back
<s> now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought i had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who had brought the soldiers there he had asked me if i was a deceiving imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the hunt against him
<s> would he believe that i was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest and had betrayed him
<s> it was of no use asking myself this question now
<s> there i was on joe s back and there was joe beneath me charging at the ditches like a hunter and stimulating mr
<s> wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and to keep up with us
<s> the soldiers were in front of us extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man
<s> we were taking the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist
<s> either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it
<s> under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain though all of a watery lead colour
<s> with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at joe s broad shoulder i looked all about for any sign of the convicts
<s> i could see none i could hear none
<s> mr
<s> wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his blowing and hard breathing but i knew the sounds by this time and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit
<s> i got a dreadful start when i thought i heard the file still going but it was only a sheep bell
<s> the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us and the cattle their heads turned from the wind and sleet stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except these things and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes
<s> the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all stopped
<s> for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a long shout
<s> it was repeated
<s> it was at a distance towards the east but it was long and loud
<s> nay there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together if one might judge from a confusion in the sound
<s> to this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath when joe and i came up
<s> after another moment s listening joe who was a good judge agreed and mr
<s> wopsle who was a bad judge agreed
<s> the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not be answered but that the course should be changed and that his men should make towards it at the double
<s> so we slanted to the right where the east was and joe pounded away so wonderfully that i had to hold on tight to keep my seat
<s> it was a run indeed now and what joe called in the only two words he spoke all the time a winder
<s> down banks and up banks and over gates and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared where he went
<s> as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice
<s> sometimes it seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped
<s> when it broke out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we after them
<s> after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one voice calling murder and another voice convicts runaways guard this way for the runaway convicts then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle and then would break out again
<s> and when it had come to this the soldiers ran like deer and joe too
<s> the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two of his men ran in close upon him
<s> their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in
<s> here are both men panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a ditch
<s> surrender you two and confound you for two wild beasts come asunder
<s> water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and blows were being struck when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other one
<s> both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but of course i knew them both directly
<s> mind said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves and shaking torn hair from his fingers i took him i give him up to you mind that
<s> it s not much to be particular about said the sergeant it ll do you small good my man being in the same plight yourself
<s> handcuffs there
<s> i don t expect it to do me any good
<s> i don t want it to do me more good than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh
<s> i took him
<s> he knows it
<s> that s enough for me
<s> the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over
<s> he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling
<s> take notice guard he tried to murder me were his first words
<s> tried to murder him said my convict disdainfully
<s> try and not do it i took him and giv him up that s what i done
<s> i not only prevented him getting off the marshes but i dragged him here dragged him this far on his way back
<s> he s a gentleman if you please this villain
<s> now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me
<s> murder him worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag him back
<s> the other one still gasped he tried he tried to murder me
<s> bear bear witness
<s> lookee here said my convict to the sergeant
<s> single handed i got clear of the prison ship i made a dash and i done it
<s> i could ha got clear of these death cold flats likewise look at my leg you won t find much iron on it if i hadn t made the discovery that he was here
<s> let him go free let him profit by the means as i found out let him make a tool of me afresh and again once more no no no
<s> if i had died at the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands i d have held to him with that grip that you should have been safe to find him in my hold
<s> the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion repeated he tried to murder me
<s> i should have been a dead man if you had not come up
<s> he lies said my convict with fierce energy
<s> he s a liar born and he ll die a liar
<s> look at his face ain t it written there let him turn those eyes of his on me
<s> i defy him to do it
<s> the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked at the soldiers and looked about at the marshes and at the sky but certainly did not look at the speaker
<s> do you see him pursued my convict
<s> do you see what a villain he is do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes that s how he looked when we were tried together
<s> he never looked at me
<s> the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker with the words you are not much to look at and with a half taunting glance at the bound hands
<s> at that point my convict became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers
<s> didn t i tell you said the other convict then that he would murder me if he could and any one could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes like thin snow
<s> enough of this parley said the sergeant
<s> light those torches
<s> as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time and saw me
<s> i had alighted from joe s back on the brink of the ditch when we came up and had not moved since
<s> i looked at him eagerly when he looked at me and slightly moved my hands and shook my head
<s> i had been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my innocence
<s> it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it all passed in a moment
<s> but if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having been more attentive
<s> the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four torches and took one himself and distributed the others
<s> it had been almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards very dark
<s> before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in a ring fired twice into the air
<s> presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river
<s> all right said the sergeant
<s> march
<s> we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear
<s> you are expected on board said the sergeant to my convict they know you are coming
<s> don t straggle my man
<s> close up here
<s> the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard
<s> i had hold of joe s hand now and joe carried one of the torches
<s> mr
<s> wopsle had been for going back but joe was resolved to see it out so we went on with the party
<s> there was a reasonably good path now mostly on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice gate
<s> when i looked round i could see the other lights coming in after us
<s> the torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and i could see those too lying smoking and flaring
<s> i could see nothing else but black darkness
<s> our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they limped along in the midst of the muskets
<s> we could not go fast because of their lameness and they were so spent that two or three times we had to halt while they rested
<s> after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing place
<s> there was a guard in the hut and they challenged and the sergeant answered
<s> then we went into the hut where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once
<s> three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great coats were not much interested in us but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again
<s> the sergeant made some kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board first
<s> my convict never looked at me except that once
<s> while we stood in the hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures
<s> suddenly he turned to the sergeant and remarked
<s> i wish to say something respecting this escape
<s> it may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me
<s> you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded but you have no call to say it here
<s> you ll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it before it s done with you know
<s> i know but this is another pint a separate matter
<s> a man can t starve at least i can t
<s> i took some wittles up at the willage over yonder where the church stands a most out on the marshes
<s> you mean stole said the sergeant
<s> and i ll tell you where from
<s> from the blacksmith s
<s> halloa said the sergeant staring at joe
<s> halloa pip said joe staring at me
<s> it was some broken wittles that s what it was and a dram of liquor and a pie
<s> have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith asked the sergeant confidentially
<s> my wife did at the very moment when you came in
<s> don t you know pip
<s> so said my convict turning his eyes on joe in a moody manner and without the least glance at me so you re the blacksmith are you than i m sorry to say i ve eat your pie
<s> god knows you re welcome to it so far as it was ever mine returned joe with a saving remembrance of mrs
<s> joe
<s> we don t know what you have done but we wouldn t have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellow creatur
<s> would us pip
<s> the something that i had noticed before clicked in the man s throat again and he turned his back
<s> the boat had returned and his guard were ready so we followed him to the landing place made of rough stakes and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself
<s> no one seemed surprised to see him or interested in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way you which was the signal for the dip of the oars
<s> by the light of the torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore like a wicked noah s ark
<s> cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains the prison ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners
<s> we saw the boat go alongside and we saw him taken up the side and disappear
<s> then the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with him
<s> chapter vi
<s> my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but i hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it
<s> i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to mrs
<s> joe when the fear of being found out was lifted off me
<s> but i loved joe perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him and as to him my inner self was not so easily composed
<s> it was much upon my mind particularly when i first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell joe the whole truth
<s> yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that if i did he would think me worse than i was
<s> the fear of losing joe s confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my tongue
<s> i morbidly represented to myself that if joe knew it i never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker without thinking that he was meditating on it
<s> that if joe knew it i never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterday s meat or pudding when it came on to day s table without thinking that he was debating whether i had been in the pantry
<s> that if joe knew it and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it would bring a rush of blood to my face
<s> in a word i was too cowardly to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing what i knew to be wrong
<s> i had had no intercourse with the world at that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner
<s> quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of action for myself
<s> as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prison ship joe took me on his back again and carried me home
<s> he must have had a tiresome journey of it for mr
<s> wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with joe and myself
<s> in his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital offence
<s> by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard through having been newly set upon my feet and through having been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues
<s> as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders and the restorative exclamation yah was there ever such a boy as this from my sister i found joe telling them about the convict s confession and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook made out after carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips and as mr
<s> pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise cart over everybody it was agreed that it must be so
<s> mr
<s> wopsle indeed wildly cried out no with the feeble malice of a tired man but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously set at naught not to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not calculated to inspire confidence
<s> this was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a slumberous offence to the company s eyesight and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs
<s> my state of mind as i have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions
<s> chapter vii
<s> at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out
<s> my construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my father s exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family
<s> neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at all accurate for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my declaration that i was to walk in the same all the days of my life laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright s or up by the mill
<s> when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to joe and until i could assume that dignity i was not to be what mrs
<s> joe called pompeyed or as i render it pampered
<s> therefore i was not only odd boy about the forge but if any neighbour happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favoured with the employment
<s> in order however that our superior position might not be compromised thereby a money box was kept on the kitchen mantel shelf into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped
<s> i have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure
<s> mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt kept an evening school in the village that is to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it
<s> she rented a small cottage and mr
<s> wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally bumping on the ceiling
<s> there was a fiction that mr
<s> wopsle examined the scholars once a quarter
<s> what he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antony s oration over the body of caesar
<s> this was always followed by collins s ode on the passions wherein i particularly venerated mr
<s> wopsle as revenge throwing his blood stained sword in thunder down and taking the war denouncing trumpet with a withering look
<s> it was not with me then as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions and compared them with collins and wopsle rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen
<s> mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt besides keeping this educational institution kept in the same room a little general shop
<s> she had no idea what stock she had or what the price of anything in it was but there was a little greasy memorandum book kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transactions
<s> biddy was mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt s granddaughter i confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was to mr
<s> wopsle
<s> she was an orphan like myself like me too had been brought up by hand
<s> she was most noticeable i thought in respect of her extremities for her hair always wanted brushing her hands always wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel
<s> this description must be received with a week day limitation
<s> on sundays she went to church elaborated
<s> much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble bush getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter
<s> after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition
<s> but at last i began in a purblind groping way to read write and cipher on the very smallest scale
<s> one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending great efforts on the production of a letter to joe
<s> i think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes for it was a long time after and it was winter and a hard frost
<s> with an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference i contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle
<s> mi deer jo i ope u r krwite well i ope i shal
<s> son b habell 4 2 teedge u jo an then we shorl b
<s> so glodd an wen i m prengtd 2 u jo wot larx an
<s> bleve me inf xn pip
<s> there was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with joe by letter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone
<s> but i delivered this written communication slate and all with my own hand and joe received it as a miracle of erudition
<s> i say pip old chap cried joe opening his blue eyes wide what a scholar you are an t you
<s> i should like to be said i glancing at the slate as he held it with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly
<s> why here s a j said joe and a o equal to anythink here s a j and a o pip and a j o joe
<s> 0072m
<s> i had never heard joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i accidentally held our prayer book upside down that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right
<s> wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching joe i should have to begin quite at the beginning i said ah but read the rest jo
<s> the rest eh pip said joe looking at it with a slow searching eye one two three
<s> why here s three js and three os and three j o joes in it pip
<s> i leaned over joe and with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter
<s> astonishing said joe when i had finished
<s> you are a scholar
<s> how do you spell gargery joe i asked him with a modest patronage
<s> i don t spell it at all said joe
<s> but supposing you did
<s> it can t be supposed said joe
<s> tho i m uncommon fond of reading too
<s> are you joe
<s> on common
<s> give me said joe a good book or a good newspaper and sit me down afore a good fire and i ask no better
<s> lord he continued after rubbing his knees a little when you do come to a j and a o and says you here at last is a j o joe how interesting reading is
<s> i derived from this that joe s education like steam was yet in its infancy
<s> pursuing the subject i inquired
<s> didn t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me
<s> no pip
<s> why didn t you ever go to school joe when you were as little as me
<s> well pip said joe taking up the poker and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars i ll tell you
<s> my father pip he were given to drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at my mother most onmerciful
<s> it were a most the only hammering he did indeed xcepting at myself
<s> and he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didn t hammer at his anwil
<s> you re a listening and understanding pip
<s> yes joe
<s> consequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several times and then my mother she d go out to work and she d say joe she d say now please god you shall have some schooling child and she d put me to school
<s> but my father were that good in his hart that he couldn t abear to be without us
<s> so he d come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him
<s> and then he took us home and hammered us
<s> which you see pip said joe pausing in his meditative raking of the fire and looking at me were a drawback on my learning
<s> certainly poor joe
<s> though mind you pip said joe with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar rendering unto all their doo and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his hart don t you see
<s> i didn t see but i didn t say so
<s> well joe pursued somebody must keep the pot a biling pip or the pot won t bile don t you know
<s> i saw that and said so
<s> consequence my father didn t make objections to my going to work so i went to work at my present calling which were his too if he would have followed it and i worked tolerable hard i assure you pip
<s> in time i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit
<s> and it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that whatsume er the failings on his part remember reader he were that good in his heart
<s> joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself
<s> i made it said joe my own self
<s> i made it in a moment
<s> it was like striking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow
<s> i never was so much surprised in all my life couldn t credit my own ed to tell you the truth hardly believed it were my own ed
<s> as i was saying pip it were my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs money cut it how you will small or large and it were not done
<s> not to mention bearers all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother
<s> she were in poor elth and quite broke
<s> she weren t long of following poor soul and her share of peace come round at last
<s> joe s blue eyes turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them and then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner with the round knob on the top of the poker
<s> it were but lonesome then said joe living here alone and i got acquainted with your sister
<s> now pip joe looked firmly at me as if he knew i was not going to agree with him your sister is a fine figure of a woman
<s> i could not help looking at the fire in an obvious state of doubt
<s> whatever family opinions or whatever the world s opinions on that subject may be pip your sister is joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following a fine figure of a woman
<s> i could think of nothing better to say than i am glad you think so joe
<s> so am i returned joe catching me up
<s> i am glad i think so pip
<s> a little redness or a little matter of bone here or there what does it signify to me
<s> i sagaciously observed if it didn t signify to him to whom did it signify
<s> certainly assented joe
<s> that s it
<s> you re right old chap when i got acquainted with your sister it were the talk how she was bringing you up by hand
<s> very kind of her too all the folks said and i said along with all the folks
<s> as to you joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was dear me you d have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself
<s> not exactly relishing this i said never mind me joe
<s> but i did mind you pip he returned with tender simplicity
<s> when i offered to your sister to keep company and to be asked in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge i said to her and bring the poor little child
<s> god bless the poor little child i said to your sister there s room for him at the forge
<s> i broke out crying and begging pardon and hugged joe round the neck who dropped the poker to hug me and to say ever the best of friends an t us pip don t cry old chap
<s> when this little interruption was over joe resumed
<s> well you see pip and here we are that s about where it lights here we are now when you take me in hand in my learning pip and i tell you beforehand i am awful dull most awful dull mrs
<s> joe mustn t see too much of what we re up to
<s> it must be done as i may say on the sly
<s> and why on the sly i ll tell you why pip
<s> he had taken up the poker again without which i doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration
<s> your sister is given to government
<s> given to government joe i was startled for i had some shadowy idea and i am afraid i must add hope that joe had divorced her in a favour of the lords of the admiralty or treasury
<s> given to government said joe
<s> which i meantersay the government of you and myself
<s> oh
<s> and she an t over partial to having scholars on the premises joe continued and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar for fear as i might rise
<s> like a sort of rebel don t you see
<s> i was going to retort with an inquiry and had got as far as why when joe stopped me
<s> stay a bit
<s> i know what you re a going to say pip stay a bit i don t deny that your sister comes the mo gul over us now and again
<s> i don t deny that she do throw us back falls and that she do drop down upon us heavy
<s> at such times as when your sister is on the ram page pip joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door candour compels fur to admit that she is a buster
<s> joe pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital bs
<s> why don t i rise that were your observation when i broke it off pip
<s> yes joe
<s> well said joe passing the poker into his left hand that he might feel his whisker and i had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation your sister s a master mind
<s> a master mind
<s> what s that i asked in some hope of bringing him to a stand
<s> but joe was readier with his definition than i had expected and completely stopped me by arguing circularly and answering with a fixed look her
<s> and i ain t a master mind joe resumed when he had unfixed his look and got back to his whisker
<s> and last of all pip and this i want to say very serious to you old chap i see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that i m dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what s right by a woman and i d fur rather of the two go wrong the t other way and be a little ill conwenienced myself
<s> i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warn t no tickler for you old chap i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the up and down and straight on it pip and i hope you ll overlook shortcomings
<s> young as i was i believe that i dated a new admiration of joe from that night
<s> we were equals afterwards as we had been before but afterwards at quiet times when i sat looking at joe and thinking about him i had a new sensation of feeling conscious that i was looking up to joe in my heart
<s> however said joe rising to replenish the fire here s the dutch clock a working himself up to being equal to strike eight of em and she s not come home yet i hope uncle pumblechook s mare mayn t have set a forefoot on a piece o ice and gone down
<s> mrs
<s> joe made occasional trips with uncle pumblechook on market days to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman s judgment uncle pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant
<s> this was market day and mrs
<s> joe was out on one of these expeditions
<s> joe made the fire and swept the hearth and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise cart
<s> it was a dry cold night and the wind blew keenly and the frost was white and hard
<s> a man would die to night of lying out on the marshes i thought
<s> and then i looked at the stars and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude
<s> here comes the mare said joe ringing like a peal of bells
<s> the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual
<s> we got a chair out ready for mrs
<s> joe s alighting and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place
<s> when we had completed these preparations they drove up wrapped to the eyes
<s> mrs
<s> joe was soon landed and uncle pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with a cloth and we were soon all in the kitchen carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire
<s> now said mrs
<s> joe unwrapping herself with haste and excitement and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings if this boy ain t grateful this night he never will be
<s> i looked as grateful as any boy possibly could who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression
<s> it s only to be hoped said my sister that he won t be pompeyed
<s> but i have my fears
<s> she ain t in that line mum said mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> she knows better
<s> she i looked at joe making the motion with my lips and eyebrows she joe looked at me making the motion with his lips and eyebrows she my sister catching him in the act he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions and looked at her
<s> well said my sister in her snappish way
<s> what are you staring at is the house afire
<s> which some individual joe politely hinted mentioned she
<s> and she is a she i suppose said my sister
<s> unless you call miss havisham a he
<s> and i doubt if even you ll go so far as that
<s> miss havisham up town said joe
<s> is there any miss havisham down town returned my sister
<s> she wants this boy to go and play there
<s> and of course he s going
<s> and he had better play there said my sister shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive or i ll work him
<s> i had heard of miss havisham up town everybody for miles round had heard of miss havisham up town as an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers and who led a life of seclusion
<s> well to be sure said joe astounded
<s> i wonder how she come to know pip
<s> noodle cried my sister
<s> who said she knew him
<s> which some individual joe again politely hinted mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there
<s> and couldn t she ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there isn t it just barely possible that uncle pumblechook may be a tenant of hers and that he may sometimes we won t say quarterly or half yearly for that would be requiring too much of you but sometimes go there to pay his rent and couldn t she then ask uncle pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there and couldn t uncle pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for us though you may not think it joseph in a tone of the deepest reproach as if he were the most callous of nephews then mention this boy standing prancing here which i solemnly declare i was not doing that i have for ever been a willing slave to
<s> good again cried uncle pumblechook
<s> well put prettily pointed good indeed now joseph you know the case
<s> no joseph said my sister still in a reproachful manner while joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose you do not yet though you may not think it know the case
<s> you may consider that you do but you do not joseph
<s> for you do not know that uncle pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell this boy s fortune may be made by his going to miss havisham s has offered to take him into town to night in his own chaise cart and to keep him to night and to take him with his own hands to miss havisham s to morrow morning
<s> and lor a mussy me cried my sister casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation here i stand talking to mere mooncalfs with uncle pumblechook waiting and the mare catching cold at the door and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot
<s> with that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps of water butts and i was soaped and kneaded and towelled and thumped and harrowed and rasped until i really was quite beside myself
<s> i may here remark that i suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority with the ridgy effect of a wedding ring passing unsympathetically over the human countenance
<s> when my ablutions were completed i was put into clean linen of the stiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit
<s> i was then delivered over to mr
<s> pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the sheriff and who let off upon me the speech that i knew he had been dying to make all along boy be forever grateful to all friends but especially unto them which brought you up by hand
<s> good bye joe
<s> god bless you pip old chap
<s> i had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds i could at first see no stars from the chaise cart
<s> but they twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the questions why on earth i was going to play at miss havisham s and what on earth i was expected to play at

<s> pumblechook s premises in the high street of the market town were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be
<s> it appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop and i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the tied up brown paper packets inside whether the flower seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom
<s> it was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this speculation
<s> on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows
<s> in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook wore corduroys and so did his shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavour about the corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavour about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i hardly knew which was which
<s> the same opportunity served me for noticing that mr
<s> pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist
<s> the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with a magnifying glass at his eye and always inspected by a group of smock frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop window seemed to be about the only person in the high street whose trade engaged his attention
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight o clock in the parlour behind the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises
<s> i considered mr
<s> pumblechook wretched company
<s> besides being possessed by my sister s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic
<s> on my politely bidding him good morning he said pompously seven times nine boy and how should i be able to answer dodged in that way in a strange place on an empty stomach i was hungry but before i had swallowed a morsel he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast
<s> seven and four and eight and six and two and ten and so on
<s> and after each figure was disposed of it was as much as i could do to get a bite or a sup before the next came while he sat at his ease guessing nothing and eating bacon and hot roll in if i may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner
<s> for such reasons i was very glad when ten o clock came and we started for miss havisham s though i was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which i should acquit myself under that lady s roof
<s> within a quarter of an hour we came to miss havisham s house which was of old brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it
<s> some of the windows had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were rustily barred
<s> there was a courtyard in front and that was barred so we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come to open it
<s> while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then mr
<s> pumblechook said and fourteen but i pretended not to hear him and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery
<s> no brewing was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time
<s> a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name to which my conductor replied pumblechook
<s> the voice returned quite right and the window was shut again and a young lady came across the court yard with keys in her hand
<s> this said mr
<s> pumblechook is pip
<s> this is pip is it returned the young lady who was very pretty and seemed very proud come in pip
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate
<s> oh she said
<s> did you wish to see miss havisham
<s> if miss havisham wished to see me returned mr
<s> pumblechook discomfited
<s> ah said the girl but you see she don t
<s> she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that mr
<s> pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not protest
<s> but he eyed me severely as if i had done anything to him and departed with the words reproachfully delivered boy let your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate and sixteen but he didn t
<s> my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard
<s> it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice
<s> the brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the wooden gates of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood open away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused
<s> the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea
<s> she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt all the strong beer that s brewed there now boy
<s> i should think i could miss said i in a shy way
<s> better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy don t you think so
<s> it looks like it miss
<s> not that anybody means to try she added for that s all done with and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls
<s> as to strong beer there s enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor house
<s> 0082m
<s> is that the name of this house miss
<s> one of its names boy
<s> it has more than one then miss
<s> one more
<s> its other name was satis which is greek or latin or hebrew or all three or all one to me for enough
<s> enough house said i that s a curious name miss
<s> yes she replied but it meant more than it said
<s> it meant when it was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else
<s> they must have been easily satisfied in those days i should think
<s> but don t loiter boy
<s> though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary she was of about my own age
<s> she seemed much older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and self possessed and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one and twenty and a queen
<s> we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two chains across it outside and the first thing i noticed was that the passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there
<s> she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us
<s> at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in
<s> i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss
<s> to this she returned don t be ridiculous boy i am not going in
<s> and scornfully walked away and what was worse took the candle with her
<s> this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid
<s> however the only thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told from within to enter
<s> i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty large room well lighted with wax candles
<s> no glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it
<s> it was a dressing room as i supposed from the furniture though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me
<s> but prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking glass and that i made out at first sight to be a fine lady s dressing table
<s> whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it i cannot say
<s> in an arm chair with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see
<s> she was dressed in rich materials satins and lace and silks all of white
<s> her shoes were white
<s> and she had a long white veil dependent from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was white
<s> some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table
<s> dresses less splendid than the dress she wore and half packed trunks were scattered about
<s> she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe on the other was on the table near her hand her veil was but half arranged her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and some flowers and a prayer book all confusedly heaped about the looking glass
<s> it was not in the first few moments that i saw all these things though i saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed
<s> but i saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow
<s> i saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes
<s> i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone
<s> once i had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage lying in state
<s> once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement
<s> now waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me
<s> i should have cried out if i could
<s> who is it said the lady at the table
<s> pip ma am
<s> pip
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook s boy ma am
<s> come to play
<s> come nearer let me look at you
<s> come close
<s> it was when i stood before her avoiding her eyes that i took note of the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
<s> look at me said miss havisham
<s> you are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born
<s> i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer no
<s> do you know what i touch here she said laying her hands one upon the other on her left side
<s> yes ma am
<s> it made me think of the young man
<s> what do i touch
<s> your heart
<s> broken
<s> she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it
<s> afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they were heavy
<s> i am tired said miss havisham
<s> i want diversion and i have done with men and women
<s> play
<s> i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances
<s> i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy that i want to see some play
<s> there there with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand play play play
<s> for a moment with the fear of my sister s working me before my eyes i had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of mr
<s> pumblechook s chaise cart
<s> but i felt myself so unequal to the performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss havisham in what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said when we had taken a good look at each other
<s> are you sullen and obstinate
<s> no ma am i am very sorry for you and very sorry i can t play just now
<s> if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so i would do it if i could but it s so new here and so strange and so fine and melancholy
<s> i stopped fearing i might say too much or had already said it and we took another look at each other
<s> before she spoke again she turned her eyes from me and looked at the dress she wore and at the dressing table and finally at herself in the looking glass
<s> so new to him she muttered so old to me so strange to him so familiar to me so melancholy to both of us call estella
<s> as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was still talking to herself and kept quiet
<s> call estella she repeated flashing a look at me
<s> you can do that
<s> call estella
<s> at the door
<s> to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house bawling estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost as bad as playing to order
<s> but she answered at last and her light came along the dark passage like a star
<s> miss havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair
<s> your own one day my dear and you will use it well
<s> let me see you play cards with this boy
<s> with this boy why he is a common labouring boy
<s> i thought i overheard miss havisham answer only it seemed so unlikely well you can break his heart
<s> what do you play boy asked estella of myself with the greatest disdain
<s> nothing but beggar my neighbour miss
<s> beggar him said miss havisham to estella
<s> so we sat down to cards
<s> it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago
<s> i noticed that miss havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up
<s> as estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressing table again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never been worn
<s> i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been trodden ragged
<s> without this arrest of everything this standing still of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like grave clothes or the long veil so like a shroud
<s> so she sat corpse like as we played at cards the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper
<s> i knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust
<s> he calls the knaves jacks this boy said estella with disdain before our first game was out
<s> and what coarse hands he has and what thick boots
<s> i had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before but i began to consider them a very indifferent pair
<s> her contempt for me was so strong that it became infectious and i caught it
<s> she won the game and i dealt
<s> i misdealt as was only natural when i knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for a stupid clumsy labouring boy
<s> you say nothing of her remarked miss havisham to me as she looked on
<s> she says many hard things of you but you say nothing of her
<s> what do you think of her
<s> i don t like to say i stammered
<s> tell me in my ear said miss havisham bending down
<s> i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper
<s> anything else
<s> i think she is very pretty
<s> anything else
<s> i think she is very insulting
<s> she was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion
<s> anything else
<s> i think i should like to go home
<s> and never see her again though she is so pretty
<s> i am not sure that i shouldn t like to see her again but i should like to go home now
<s> you shall go soon said miss havisham aloud
<s> play the game out
<s> saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost sure that miss havisham s face could not smile
<s> it had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression most likely when all the things about her had become transfixed and it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again
<s> her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul within and without under the weight of a crushing blow
<s> i played the game to an end with estella and she beggared me
<s> she threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she despised them for having been won of me
<s> when shall i have you here again said miss havisham
<s> let me think
<s> i was beginning to remind her that to day was wednesday when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand
<s> there there i know nothing of days of the week i know nothing of weeks of the year
<s> come again after six days
<s> you hear
<s> yes ma am
<s> estella take him down
<s> let him have something to eat and let him roam and look about him while he eats
<s> go pip
<s> i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she stood it in the place where we had found it
<s> until she opened the side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must necessarily be night time
<s> the rush of the daylight quite confounded me and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours
<s> you are to wait here you boy said estella and disappeared and closed the door
<s> i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots
<s> my opinion of those accessories was not favourable
<s> they had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages
<s> i determined to ask joe why he had ever taught me to call those picture cards jacks which ought to be called knaves
<s> i wished joe had been rather more genteelly brought up and then i should have been so too
<s> she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer
<s> she put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in disgrace
<s> i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorry i cannot hit upon the right name for the smart god knows what its name was that tears started to my eyes
<s> the moment they sprang there the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them
<s> this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a contemptuous toss but with a sense i thought of having made too sure that i was so wounded and left me
<s> but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face in and got behind one of the gates in the brewery lane and leaned my sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried
<s> as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that needed counteraction
<s> my sister s bringing up had made me sensitive
<s> in the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice
<s> it may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child is small and its world is small and its rocking horse stands as many hands high according to scale as a big boned irish hunter
<s> within myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with injustice
<s> i had known from the time when i could speak that my sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me
<s> i had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks
<s> through all my punishments disgraces fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid and very sensitive
<s> i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate
<s> the bread and meat were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon in spirits to look about me
<s> to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeon house in the brewery yard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it
<s> but there were no pigeons in the dove cot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in the storehouse no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat
<s> all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke
<s> in a by yard there was a wilderness of empty casks which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone and in this respect i remember those recluses as being like most others
<s> behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old wall not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked there and that estella was walking away from me even then
<s> but she seemed to be everywhere
<s> for when i yielded to the temptation presented by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks
<s> she had her back towards me and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands and never looked round and passed out of my view directly
<s> so in the brewery itself by which i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer and where the brewing utensils still were
<s> when i first went into it and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about me i saw her pass among the extinguished fires and ascend some light iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going out into the sky
<s> it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened to my fancy
<s> i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a stranger thing long afterwards
<s> i turned my eyes a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure hanging there by the neck
<s> a figure all in yellow white with but one shoe to the feet and it hung so that i could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was miss havisham s with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me
<s> in the terror of seeing the figure and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it
<s> and my terror was greatest of all when i found no figure there
<s> nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the court yard gate and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought me round
<s> even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon as i did but that i saw estella approaching with the keys to let me out
<s> she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i thought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason
<s> she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the gate and stood holding it
<s> i was passing out without looking at her when she touched me with a taunting hand
<s> why don t you cry
<s> because i don t want to
<s> you do said she
<s> you have been crying till you are half blind and you are near crying again now
<s> she laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me
<s> i went straight to mr
<s> pumblechook s and was immensely relieved to find him not at home
<s> so leaving word with the shopman on what day i was wanted at miss havisham s again i set off on the four mile walk to our forge pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply revolving that i was a common labouring boy that my hands were coarse that my boots were thick that i had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves jacks that i was much more ignorant than i had considered myself last night and generally that i was in a low lived bad way
<s> chapter ix
<s> when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss havisham s and asked a number of questions
<s> and i soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall because i did not answer those questions at sufficient length
<s> if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine which i consider probable as i have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity it is the key to many reservations
<s> i felt convinced that if i described miss havisham s as my eyes had seen it i should not be understood
<s> not only that but i felt convinced that miss havisham too would not be understood and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was to say nothing of miss estella before the contemplation of mrs
<s> joe
<s> consequently i said as little as i could and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall
<s> the worst of it was that that bullying old pumblechook preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came gaping over in his chaise cart at tea time to have the details divulged to him
<s> and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eyes and mouth open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence
<s> well boy uncle pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the chair of honour by the fire
<s> how did you get on up town
<s> i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me
<s> pretty well mr
<s> pumblechook repeated
<s> pretty well is no answer
<s> tell us what you mean by pretty well boy
<s> whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps
<s> anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my obstinacy was adamantine
<s> i reflected for some time and then answered as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well
<s> my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me i had no shadow of defence for joe was busy in the forge when mr
<s> pumblechook interposed with no don t lose your temper
<s> leave this lad to me ma am leave this lad to me
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook then turned me towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said
<s> first to get our thoughts in order forty three pence
<s> i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and finding them against me went as near the answer as i could which was somewhere about eightpence off
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook then put me through my pence table from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had done for me now how much is forty three pence to which i replied after a long interval of reflection i don t know
<s> and i was so aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me and said is forty three pence seven and sixpence three fardens for instance
<s> yes said i
<s> and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and brought him to a dead stop
<s> boy what like is miss havisham mr
<s> pumblechook began again when he had recovered folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw
<s> very tall and dark i told him
<s> is she uncle asked my sister
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook winked assent from which i at once inferred that he had never seen miss havisham for she was nothing of the kind
<s> good said mr
<s> pumblechook conceitedly
<s> this is the way to have him we are beginning to hold our own i think mum
<s> i am sure uncle returned mrs
<s> joe i wish you had him always you know so well how to deal with him
<s> now boy what was she a doing of when you went in today asked mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook and mrs
<s> joe stared at one another as they well might and both repeated in a black velvet coach
<s> yes said i
<s> and miss estella that s her niece i think handed her in cake and wine at the coach window on a gold plate
<s> and we all had cake and wine on gold plates
<s> and i got up behind the coach to eat mine because she told me to
<s> was anybody else there asked mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> four dogs said i
<s> large or small
<s> immense said i
<s> and they fought for veal cutlets out of a silver basket
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook and mrs
<s> joe stared at one another again in utter amazement
<s> i was perfectly frantic a reckless witness under the torture and would have told them anything
<s> where was this coach in the name of gracious asked my sister
<s> in miss havisham s room
<s> they stared again
<s> but there weren t any horses to it
<s> i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thoughts of harnessing
<s> can this be possible uncle asked mrs
<s> joe
<s> what can the boy mean
<s> i ll tell you mum said mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> my opinion is it s a sedan chair
<s> she s flighty you know very flighty quite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedan chair
<s> did you ever see her in it uncle asked mrs
<s> joe
<s> how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see her in my life never clapped eyes upon her
<s> goodness uncle and yet you have spoken to her
<s> why don t you know said mr
<s> pumblechook testily that when i have been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way
<s> don t say you don t know that mum
<s> howsever the boy went there to play
<s> what did you play at boy
<s> we played with flags i said
<s> i beg to observe that i think of myself with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion
<s> flags echoed my sister
<s> yes said i
<s> estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and miss havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out at the coach window
<s> and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed
<s> swords repeated my sister
<s> where did you get swords from
<s> out of a cupboard said i
<s> and i saw pistols in it and jam and pills
<s> and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up with candles
<s> that s true mum said mr
<s> pumblechook with a grave nod
<s> that s the state of the case for that much i ve seen myself
<s> and then they both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand
<s> if they had asked me any more questions i should undoubtedly have betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery
<s> they were so much occupied however in discussing the marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped
<s> the subject still held them when joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea
<s> to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his related my pretended experiences
<s> now when i saw joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence but only as regarded him not in the least as regarded the other two
<s> towards joe and joe only i considered myself a young monster while they sat debating what results would come to me from miss havisham s acquaintance and favour
<s> they had no doubt that miss havisham would do something for me their doubts related to the form that something would take
<s> my sister stood out for property
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook was in favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade say the corn and seed trade for instance
<s> joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal cutlets
<s> if a fool s head can t express better opinions than that said my sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it
<s> so he went
<s> after mr
<s> pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up i stole into the forge to joe and remained by him until he had done for the night
<s> then i said before the fire goes out joe i should like to tell you something
<s> should you pip said joe drawing his shoeing stool near the forge
<s> then tell us
<s> what is it pip
<s> joe said i taking hold of his rolled up shirt sleeve and twisting it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss havisham s
<s> remember said joe
<s> i believe you wonderful
<s> it s a terrible thing joe it ain t true
<s> what are you telling of pip cried joe falling back in the greatest amazement
<s> you don t mean to say it s
<s> yes i do it s lies joe
<s> but not all of it why sure you don t mean to say pip that there was no black welwet co eh for i stood shaking my head
<s> but at least there was dogs pip come pip said joe persuasively if there warn t no weal cutlets at least there was dogs
<s> no joe
<s> a dog said joe
<s> a puppy come
<s> no joe there was nothing at all of the kind
<s> as i fixed my eyes hopelessly on joe joe contemplated me in dismay
<s> pip old chap this won t do old fellow i say where do you expect to go to
<s> it s terrible joe ain t it
<s> terrible cried joe
<s> awful what possessed you
<s> i don t know what possessed me joe i replied letting his shirt sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his feet hanging my head but i wish you hadn t taught me to call knaves at cards jacks and i wish my boots weren t so thick nor my hands so coarse
<s> and then i told joe that i felt very miserable and that i hadn t been able to explain myself to mrs
<s> joe and pumblechook who were so rude to me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss havisham s who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies had come of it somehow though i didn t know how
<s> this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for joe to deal with as for me
<s> but joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics and by that means vanquished it
<s> there s one thing you may be sure of pip said joe after some rumination namely that lies is lies
<s> howsever they come they didn t ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to the same
<s> don t you tell no more of em pip
<s> that ain t the way to get out of being common old chap
<s> and as to being common i don t make it out at all clear
<s> you are oncommon in some things
<s> you re oncommon small
<s> likewise you re a oncommon scholar
<s> no i am ignorant and backward joe
<s> why see what a letter you wrote last night wrote in print even i ve seen letters ah and from gentlefolks that i ll swear weren t wrote in print said joe
<s> i have learnt next to nothing joe
<s> you think much of me
<s> it s only that
<s> well pip said joe be it so or be it son t you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope the king upon his throne with his crown upon his ed can t sit and write his acts of parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted prince with the alphabet
<s> ah added joe with a shake of the head that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to z
<s> and i know what that is to do though i can t say i ve exactly done it
<s> there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged me
<s> whether common ones as to callings and earnings pursued joe reflectively mightn t be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones instead of going out to play with oncommon ones which reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps
<s> no joe
<s> i m sorry there weren t a flag pip
<s> whether that might be or mightn t be is a thing as can t be looked into now without putting your sister on the rampage and that s a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional
<s> lookee here pip at what is said to you by a true friend
<s> which this to you the true friend say
<s> if you can t get to be oncommon through going straight you ll never get to do it through going crooked
<s> so don t tell no more on em pip and live well and die happy
<s> you are not angry with me joe
<s> no old chap
<s> but bearing in mind that them were which i meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort alluding to them which bordered on weal cutlets and dog fighting a sincere well wisher would adwise pip their being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed
<s> that s all old chap and don t never do it no more
<s> when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget joe s recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state that i thought long after i laid me down how common estella would consider joe a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and how coarse his hands
<s> i thought how joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how miss havisham and estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the level of such common doings
<s> i fell asleep recalling what i used to do when i was at miss havisham s as though i had been there weeks or months instead of hours and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day
<s> that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me
<s> but it is the same with any life
<s> imagine one selected day struck out of it and think how different its course would have been
<s> pause you who read this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day
<s> chapter x
<s> the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of biddy everything she knew
<s> in pursuance of this luminous conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt s at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me
<s> biddy who was the most obliging of girls immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes
<s> the educational scheme or course established by mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis
<s> the pupils ate apples and put straws down one another s backs until mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch rod
<s> after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand
<s> the book had an alphabet in it some figures and tables and a little spelling that is to say it had had once
<s> as soon as this volume began to circulate mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt fell into a state of coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm
<s> the pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes
<s> this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves
<s> this part of the course was usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory students
<s> when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a page and then we all read aloud what we could or what we couldn t in a frightful chorus biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we were reading about
<s> when this horrible din had lasted a certain time it mechanically awoke mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt who staggered at a boy fortuitously and pulled his ears
<s> this was understood to terminate the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory
<s> it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden and which was also mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt s sitting room and bedchamber being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low spirited dip candle and no snuffers
<s> it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under these circumstances nevertheless i resolved to try it and that very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english d which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle
<s> of course there was a public house in the village and of course joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there
<s> i had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the three jolly bargemen that evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril
<s> to the three jolly bargemen therefore i directed my steps
<s> there was a bar at the jolly bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to be never paid off
<s> they had been there ever since i could remember and had grown more than i had
<s> but there was a quantity of chalk about our country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account
<s> it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records but as my business was with joe and not with him i merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire and where joe was smoking his pipe in company with mr
<s> wopsle and a stranger
<s> joe greeted me as usual with halloa pip old chap and the moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me
<s> he was a secret looking man whom i had never seen before
<s> his head was all on one side and one of his eyes was half shut up as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun
<s> he had a pipe in his mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time nodded
<s> so i nodded and then he nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit down there
<s> but as i was used to sit beside joe whenever i entered that place of resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space joe made for me on the opposite settle
<s> the strange man after glancing at joe and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his leg in a very odd way as it struck me
<s> you was saying said the strange man turning to joe that you was a blacksmith
<s> yes
<s> i said it you know said joe
<s> what ll you drink mr
<s> you didn t mention your name by the bye
<s> joe mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it
<s> what ll you drink mr
<s> gargery at my expense to top up with
<s> well said joe to tell you the truth i ain t much in the habit of drinking at anybody s expense but my own
<s> habit no returned the stranger but once and away and on a saturday night too
<s> come put a name to it mr
<s> gargery
<s> i wouldn t wish to be stiff company said joe
<s> rum
<s> rum repeated the stranger
<s> and will the other gentleman originate a sentiment
<s> rum said mr
<s> wopsle
<s> three rums cried the stranger calling to the landlord
<s> glasses round
<s> this other gentleman observed joe by way of introducing mr
<s> wopsle is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out
<s> our clerk at church
<s> aha said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me
<s> the lonely church right out on the marshes with graves round it
<s> that s it said joe
<s> the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself
<s> he wore a flapping broad brimmed traveller s hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair
<s> as he looked at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a half laugh come into his face
<s> i am not acquainted with this country gentlemen but it seems a solitary country towards the river
<s> most marshes is solitary said joe
<s> no doubt no doubt
<s> do you find any gypsies now or tramps or vagrants of any sort out there
<s> no said joe none but a runaway convict now and then
<s> and we don t find them easy
<s> eh mr
<s> wopsle
<s> mr
<s> wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented but not warmly
<s> seems you have been out after such asked the stranger
<s> once returned joe
<s> not that we wanted to take them you understand we went out as lookers on me and mr
<s> wopsle and pip
<s> didn t us pip
<s> yes joe
<s> the stranger looked at me again still cocking his eye as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun and said he s a likely young parcel of bones that
<s> what is it you call him
<s> pip said joe
<s> christened pip
<s> no not christened pip
<s> surname pip
<s> no said joe it s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant and is called by
<s> son of yours
<s> well said joe meditatively not of course that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at the jolly bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes well no
<s> no he ain t
<s> nevvy said the strange man
<s> well said joe with the same appearance of profound cogitation he is not no not to deceive you he is not my nevvy
<s> what the blue blazes is he asked the stranger
<s> which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength
<s> mr
<s> wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry and expounded the ties between me and joe
<s> having his hand in mr
<s> wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added as the poet says
<s> and here i may remark that when mr
<s> wopsle referred to me he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes
<s> i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances
<s> yet i do not call to mind that i was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle but some large handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronise me
<s> all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me down
<s> but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his shot and a most extraordinary shot it was
<s> it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumb show and was pointedly addressed to me
<s> he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me
<s> and he stirred it and he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file
<s> he did this so that nobody but i saw the file and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast pocket
<s> i knew it to be joe s file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the instrument
<s> i sat gazing at him spell bound
<s> but he now reclined on his settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about turnips
<s> there was a delicious sense of cleaning up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday nights which stimulated joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays than at other times
<s> the half hour and the rum and water running out together joe got up to go and took me by the hand
<s> stop half a moment mr
<s> gargery said the strange man
<s> i think i ve got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy shall have it
<s> he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some crumpled paper and gave it to me
<s> yours said he
<s> mind your own
<s> i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners and holding tight to joe
<s> he gave joe good night and he gave mr
<s> wopsle good night who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his aiming eye no not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it
<s> on the way home if i had been in a humour for talking the talk must have been all on my side for mr
<s> wopsle parted from us at the door of the jolly bargemen and joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible
<s> but i was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance and could think of nothing else
<s> my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen and joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling
<s> a bad un i ll be bound said mrs
<s> joe triumphantly or he wouldn t have given it to the boy let s look at it
<s> i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one
<s> but what s this said mrs
<s> joe throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper
<s> two one pound notes
<s> nothing less than two fat sweltering one pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle markets in the county
<s> joe caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly bargemen to restore them to their owner
<s> while he was gone i sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there
<s> presently joe came back saying that the man was gone but that he joe had left word at the three jolly bargemen concerning the notes
<s> then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under some dried rose leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlour
<s> there they remained a nightmare to me many and many a night and day
<s> i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts a feature in my low career that i had previously forgotten
<s> i was haunted by the file too
<s> a dread possessed me that when i least expected it the file would reappear
<s> i coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of miss havisham s next wednesday and in my sleep i saw the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i screamed myself awake
<s> chapter xi
<s> at the appointed time i returned to miss havisham s and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out estella
<s> she locked it after admitting me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood
<s> she took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously saying you are to come this way to day and took me to quite another part of the house
<s> the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the manor house
<s> we traversed but one side of the square however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and opened a door
<s> here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling house that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery
<s> there was a clock in the outer wall of this house
<s> like the clock in miss havisham s room and like miss havisham s watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
<s> we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling on the ground floor at the back
<s> there was some company in the room and estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and stand there boy till you are wanted
<s> there being the window i crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind looking out
<s> it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbage stalks and one box tree that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different colour as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt
<s> this was my homely thought as i contemplated the box tree
<s> there had been some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window as if it pelted me for coming there
<s> i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that its other occupants were looking at me
<s> i could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window glass but i stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection
<s> there were three ladies in the room and one gentleman
<s> before i had been standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug
<s> they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody s pleasure and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn
<s> this lady whose name was camilla very much reminded me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features
<s> indeed when i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy she had any features at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face
<s> poor dear soul said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my sister s
<s> nobody s enemy but his own
<s> it would be much more commendable to be somebody else s enemy said the gentleman far more natural
<s> cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbour
<s> sarah pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own neighbour who is
<s> miss pocket laughed and camilla laughed and said checking a yawn the idea but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too
<s> the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and emphatically very true
<s> poor soul camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time he is so very strange would anyone believe that when tom s wife died he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children s having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning good lord says he camilla what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black so like matthew the idea
<s> good points in him good points in him said cousin raymond heaven forbid i should deny good points in him but he never had and he never will have any sense of the proprieties
<s> you know i was obliged said camilla i was obliged to be firm
<s> i said it will not do for the credit of the family
<s> i told him that without deep trimmings the family was disgraced
<s> i cried about it from breakfast till dinner
<s> i injured my digestion
<s> and at last he flung out in his violent way and said with a d then do as you like
<s> thank goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things
<s> he paid for them did he not asked estella
<s> it s not the question my dear child who paid for them returned camilla
<s> i bought them
<s> and i shall often think of that with peace when i wake up in the night
<s> the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation and caused estella to say to me now boy on my turning round they all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard sarah pocket say well i am sure what next and camilla add with indignation was there ever such a fancy the i de a
<s> as we were going with our candle along the dark passage estella stopped all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with her face quite close to mine
<s> well
<s> well miss i answered almost falling over her and checking myself
<s> she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her
<s> am i pretty
<s> yes i think you are very pretty
<s> am i insulting
<s> not so much so as you were last time said i
<s> not so much so
<s> no
<s> she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with such force as she had when i answered it
<s> now said she
<s> you little coarse monster what do you think of me now
<s> i shall not tell you
<s> because you are going to tell upstairs
<s> is that it
<s> no said i that s not it
<s> why don t you cry again you little wretch
<s> because i ll never cry for you again said i
<s> which was i suppose as false a declaration as ever was made for i was inwardly crying for her then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards
<s> we went on our way upstairs after this episode and as we were going up we met a gentleman groping his way down
<s> whom have we here asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me
<s> a boy said estella
<s> he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand
<s> he took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle
<s> he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn t lie down but stood up bristling
<s> his eyes were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious
<s> he had a large watch chain and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them
<s> he was nothing to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing him well
<s> boy of the neighbourhood hey said he
<s> yes sir said i
<s> how do you come here
<s> miss havisham sent for me sir i explained
<s> well behave yourself
<s> i have a pretty large experience of boys and you re a bad set of fellows
<s> now mind said he biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself
<s> with those words he released me which i was glad of for his hand smelt of scented soap and went his way downstairs
<s> i wondered whether he could be a doctor but no i thought he couldn t be a doctor or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner
<s> there was not much time to consider the subject for we were soon in miss havisham s room where she and everything else were just as i had left them
<s> estella left me standing near the door and i stood there until miss havisham cast her eyes upon me from the dressing table
<s> so she said without being startled or surprised the days have worn away have they
<s> yes ma am
<s> to day is
<s> there there there with the impatient movement of her fingers
<s> i don t want to know
<s> are you ready to play
<s> i was obliged to answer in some confusion i don t think i am ma am
<s> not at cards again she demanded with a searching look
<s> yes ma am i could do that if i was wanted
<s> since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss havisham impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work
<s> i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to find for the other question and i said i was quite willing
<s> then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand and wait there till i come
<s> i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated
<s> from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an airless smell that was oppressive
<s> a fire had been lately kindled in the damp old fashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air like our own marsh mist
<s> certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney piece faintly lighted the chamber or it would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness
<s> it was spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces
<s> the most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together
<s> an epergne or centre piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable and as i looked along the yellow expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black fungus i saw speckle legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it and running out from it as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community
<s> i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same occurrence were important to their interests
<s> but the black beetles took no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way as if they were short sighted and hard of hearing and not on terms with one another
<s> these crawling things had fascinated my attention and i was watching them from a distance when miss havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder
<s> in her other hand she had a crutch headed stick on which she leaned and she looked like the witch of the place
<s> this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i will be laid when i am dead
<s> they shall come and look at me here
<s> with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork at the fair i shrank under her touch
<s> what do you think that is she asked me again pointing with her stick that where those cobwebs are
<s> i can t guess what it is ma am
<s> it s a great cake
<s> a bride cake
<s> mine
<s> she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come walk me walk me
<s> i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss havisham round and round the room
<s> accordingly i started at once and she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of mr
<s> pumblechook s chaise cart
<s> she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast
<s> after a while she said call estella so i went out on the landing and roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion
<s> when her light appeared i returned to miss havisham and we started away again round and round the room
<s> if only estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didn t know what to do
<s> in my politeness i would have stopped but miss havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted on with a shame faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing
<s> dear miss havisham said miss sarah pocket
<s> how well you look
<s> i do not returned miss havisham
<s> i am yellow skin and bone
<s> camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff and she murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss havisham poor dear soul certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing
<s> the idea
<s> and how are you said miss havisham to camilla
<s> as we were close to camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss havisham wouldn t stop
<s> we swept on and i felt that i was highly obnoxious to camilla
<s> thank you miss havisham she returned i am as well as can be expected
<s> why what s the matter with you asked miss havisham with exceeding sharpness
<s> nothing worth mentioning replied camilla
<s> i don t wish to make a display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the night than i am quite equal to
<s> then don t think of me retorted miss havisham
<s> very easily said remarked camilla amiably repressing a sob while a hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed
<s> raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night
<s> raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my legs
<s> chokings and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with anxiety of those i love
<s> if i could be less affectionate and sensitive i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves
<s> i am sure i wish it could be so
<s> but as to not thinking of you in the night the idea here a burst of tears
<s> the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and him i understood to be mr
<s> camilla
<s> he came to the rescue at this point and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice camilla my dear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other
<s> i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person my dear
<s> miss sarah pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnut shells and a large mouth like a cat s without the whiskers supported this position by saying no indeed my dear
<s> hem
<s> thinking is easy enough said the grave lady
<s> what is easier you know assented miss sarah pocket
<s> oh yes yes cried camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom
<s> it s all very true it s a weakness to be so affectionate but i can t help it
<s> no doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise still i wouldn t change my disposition if i could
<s> it s the cause of much suffering but it s a consolation to know i posses it when i wake up in the night
<s> here another burst of feeling
<s> miss havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber
<s> there s matthew said camilla
<s> never mixing with any natural ties never coming here to see how miss havisham is i have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut and have lain there hours insensible with my head over the side and my hair all down and my feet i don t know where
<s> much higher than your head my love said mr
<s> camilla
<s> i have gone off into that state hours and hours on account of matthew s strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me
<s> really i must say i should think not interposed the grave lady
<s> you see my dear added miss sarah pocket a blandly vicious personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to thank you my love
<s> without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed camilla i have remained in that state hours and hours and raymond is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the piano forte tuner s across the street where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance and now to be told here camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there
<s> when this same matthew was mentioned miss havisham stopped me and herself and stood looking at the speaker
<s> this change had a great influence in bringing camilla s chemistry to a sudden end
<s> matthew will come and see me at last said miss havisham sternly when i am laid on that table
<s> that will be his place there striking the table with her stick at my head and yours will be there and your husband s there and sarah pocket s there and georgiana s there now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me
<s> and now go
<s> at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in a new place
<s> she now said walk me walk me and we went on again
<s> i suppose there s nothing to be done exclaimed camilla but comply and depart
<s> it s something to have seen the object of one s love and duty for even so short a time
<s> i shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when i wake up in the night
<s> i wish matthew could have that comfort but he sets it at defiance
<s> i am determined not to make a display of my feelings but it s very hard to be told one wants to feast on one s relations as if one was a giant and to be told to go
<s> the bare idea
<s> mr
<s> camilla interposing as mrs
<s> camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view and kissing her hand to miss havisham was escorted forth
<s> sarah pocket and georgiana contended who should remain last but sarah was too knowing to be outdone and ambled round georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence
<s> sarah pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss havisham dear and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest
<s> while estella was away lighting them down miss havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly
<s> at last she stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it some seconds
<s> this is my birthday pip
<s> i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick
<s> i don t suffer it to be spoken of
<s> i don t suffer those who were here just now or any one to speak of it
<s> they come here on the day but they dare not refer to it
<s> of course i made no further effort to refer to it
<s> on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it was brought here
<s> it and i have worn away together
<s> the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me
<s> she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state to crumble under a touch
<s> when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when they lay me dead in my bride s dress on the bride s table which shall be done and which will be the finished curse upon him so much the better if it is done on this day
<s> she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there
<s> i remained quiet
<s> estella returned and she too remained quiet
<s> it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time
<s> in the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners i even had an alarming fancy that estella and i might presently begin to decay
<s> at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an instant miss havisham said let me see you two play cards why have you not begun with that we returned to her room and sat down as before i was beggared as before and again as before miss havisham watched us all the time directed my attention to estella s beauty and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on estella s breast and hair
<s> estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she did not condescend to speak
<s> when we had played some half dozen games a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dog like manner
<s> there too i was again left to wander about as i liked
<s> it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last occasion open or shut
<s> enough that i saw no gate then and that i saw one now
<s> as it stood open and as i knew that estella had let the visitors out for she had returned with the keys in her hand i strolled into the garden and strolled all over it
<s> it was quite a wilderness and there were old melon frames and cucumber frames in it which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan
<s> when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen down grape vine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal corner upon which i had looked out of the window
<s> never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair
<s> this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me
<s> he had been at his books when i had found myself staring at him and i now saw that he was inky
<s> halloa said he young fellow
<s> halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to be best answered by itself i said halloa politely omitting young fellow
<s> who let you in said he
<s> miss estella
<s> who gave you leave to prowl about
<s> miss estella
<s> come and fight said the pale young gentleman
<s> what could i do but follow him i have often asked myself the question since but what else could i do his manner was so final and i was so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a spell
<s> stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many paces
<s> i ought to give you a reason for fighting too
<s> there it is in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another daintily flung one of his legs up behind him pulled my hair slapped his hands again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach
<s> the bull like proceeding last mentioned besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat
<s> i therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha would you and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience
<s> laws of the game said he
<s> here he skipped from his left leg on to his right
<s> regular rules here he skipped from his right leg on to his left
<s> come to the ground and go through the preliminaries here he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of things while i looked helplessly at him
<s> i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous but i felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention
<s> therefore i followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish
<s> on his asking me if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying yes he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar
<s> available for both he said placing these against the wall
<s> and then fell to pulling off not only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once light hearted business like and bloodthirsty
<s> although he did not look very healthy having pimples on his face and a breaking out at his mouth these dreadful preparations quite appalled me
<s> i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance
<s> for the rest he was a young gentleman in a grey suit when not denuded for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development
<s> my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone
<s> i never have been so surprised in my life as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore shortened
<s> but he was on his feet directly and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again
<s> the second greatest surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again looking up at me out of a black eye
<s> his spirit inspired me with great respect
<s> he seemed to have no strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out of the water bottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last
<s> he got heavily bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i hit him but he came up again and again and again until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall
<s> even after that crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times not knowing where i was but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out that means you have won
<s> he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory
<s> indeed i go so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast
<s> however i got dressed darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same to you
<s> when i got into the courtyard i found estella waiting with the keys
<s> but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something had happened to delight her
<s> instead of going straight to the gate too she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me
<s> come here you may kiss me if you like
<s> i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me
<s> i think i would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek
<s> but i felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and that it was worth nothing
<s> what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night sky and joe s furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road
<s> chapter xii
<s> my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman
<s> the more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me
<s> i felt that the pale young gentleman s blood was on my head and that the law would avenge it
<s> without having any definite idea of the penalties i had incurred it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe punishment
<s> for some days i even kept close at home and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon me
<s> the pale young gentleman s nose had stained my trousers and i tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night
<s> i had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman s teeth and i twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before the judges
<s> when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence my terrors reached their height
<s> whether myrmidons of justice especially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the gate whether miss havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house might rise in those grave clothes of hers draw a pistol and shoot me dead whether suborned boys a numerous band of mercenaries might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery and cuff me until i was no more it was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features
<s> however go to miss havisham s i must and go i did
<s> and behold nothing came of the late struggle
<s> it was not alluded to in any way and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises
<s> i found the same gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the windows of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within and all was lifeless
<s> only in the corner where the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young gentleman s existence
<s> there were traces of his gore in that spot and i covered them with garden mould from the eye of man
<s> on the broad landing between miss havisham s own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out i saw a garden chair a light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind
<s> it had been placed there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular occupation of pushing miss havisham in this chair when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across the landing and round the other room
<s> over and over and over again we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch
<s> i insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months
<s> as we began to be more used to one another miss havisham talked more to me and asked me such questions as what had i learnt and what was i going to be i told her i was going to be apprenticed to joe i believed and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end
<s> but she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer my being ignorant
<s> neither did she ever give me any money or anything but my daily dinner nor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my services
<s> estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told me i might kiss her again
<s> sometimes she would coldly tolerate me sometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite familiar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she hated me
<s> miss havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were alone does she grow prettier and prettier pip and when i said yes for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily
<s> also when we played at cards miss havisham would look on with a miserly relish of estella s moods whatever they were
<s> and sometimes when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what to say or do miss havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their hearts my pride and hope break their hearts and have no mercy
<s> there was a song joe used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the burden was old clem
<s> this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation towards smiths
<s> it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clem s respected name
<s> thus you were to hammer boys round old clem with a thump and a sound old clem beat it out beat it out old clem with a clink for the stout old clem blow the fire blow the fire old clem roaring dryer soaring higher old clem one day soon after the appearance of the chair miss havisham suddenly saying to me with the impatient movement of her fingers there there there sing i was surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor
<s> it happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep
<s> after that it became customary with us to have it as we moved about and estella would often join in though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind
<s> what could i become with these surroundings how could my character fail to be influenced by them is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed as my eyes were when i came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms
<s> perhaps i might have told joe about the pale young gentleman if i had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which i had confessed
<s> under the circumstances i felt that joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach therefore i said nothing of him
<s> besides that shrinking from having miss havisham and estella discussed which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time went on
<s> i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy but i told poor biddy everything
<s> why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though i think i know now
<s> meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit
<s> that ass pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister and i really do believe to this hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise cart they would have done it
<s> the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him as it were to operate upon and he would drag me up from my stool usually by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum here is this boy here is this boy which you brought up by hand
<s> hold up your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do
<s> now mum with respections to this boy and then he would rumple my hair the wrong way which from my earliest remembrance as already hinted i have in my soul denied the right of any fellow creature to do and would hold me before him by the sleeve a spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself
<s> then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about miss havisham and about what she would do with me and for me that i used to want quite painfully to burst into spiteful tears fly at pumblechook and pummel him all over
<s> in these dialogues my sister spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference while pumblechook himself self constituted my patron would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job
<s> in these discussions joe bore no part
<s> but he was often talked at while they were in progress by reason of mrs
<s> joe s perceiving that he was not favourable to my being taken from the forge
<s> i was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to joe and when joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his hands shake him and put it away
<s> there was a most irritating end to every one of these debates
<s> all in a moment with nothing to lead up to it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as it were incidentally would swoop upon me with come there s enough of you you get along to bed you ve given trouble enough for one night i hope as if i had besought them as a favour to bother my life out
<s> we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my shoulder and said with some displeasure
<s> you are growing tall pip
<s> i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which i had no control
<s> she said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me again and presently again and after that looked frowning and moody
<s> on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and i had landed her at her dressing table she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers
<s> tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours
<s> joe gargery ma am
<s> meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to
<s> yes miss havisham
<s> you had better be apprenticed at once
<s> would gargery come here with you and bring your indentures do you think
<s> i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be asked
<s> then let him come
<s> at any particular time miss havisham
<s> there there i know nothing about times
<s> let him come soon and come along with you
<s> when i got home at night and delivered this message for joe my sister went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous period
<s> she asked me and joe whether we supposed she was door mats under our feet and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously thought she was fit for when she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries she threw a candlestick at joe burst into a loud sobbing got out the dustpan which was always a very bad sign put on her coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent
<s> not satisfied with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbing brush and cleaned us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the back yard
<s> it was ten o clock at night before we ventured to creep in again and then she asked joe why he hadn t married a negress slave at once joe offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation
<s> chapter xiii
<s> it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see joe arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss havisham s
<s> however as he thought his court suit necessary to the occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his working dress the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled up his shirt collar so very high behind that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers
<s> at breakfast time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us and being left at uncle pumblechook s and called for when we had done with our fine ladies a way of putting the case from which joe appeared inclined to augur the worst
<s> the forge was shut up for the day and joe inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work the monosyllable hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken
<s> we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it was a fine bright day
<s> i am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously but i rather think they were displayed as articles of property much as cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession
<s> when we came to pumblechook s my sister bounced in and left us
<s> as it was almost noon joe and i held straight on to miss havisham s house
<s> estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce
<s> estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew so well
<s> i followed next to her and joe came last
<s> when i looked back at joe in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes
<s> estella told me we were both to go in so i took joe by the coat cuff and conducted him into miss havisham s presence
<s> she was seated at her dressing table and looked round at us immediately
<s> oh said she to joe
<s> you are the husband of the sister of this boy
<s> i could hardly have imagined dear old joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with his tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm
<s> you are the husband repeated miss havisham of the sister of this boy
<s> it was very aggravating but throughout the interview joe persisted in addressing me instead of miss havisham
<s> which i meantersay pip joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man
<s> well said miss havisham
<s> and you have reared the boy with the intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so mr
<s> gargery
<s> you know pip replied joe as you and me were ever friends and it were looked for ard to betwixt us as being calc lated to lead to larks
<s> not but what pip if you had ever made objections to the business such as its being open to black and sut or such like not but what they would have been attended to don t you see
<s> has the boy said miss havisham ever made any objection does he like the trade
<s> which it is well beknown to yourself pip returned joe strengthening his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that it were the wish of your own hart
<s> i saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on to say and there weren t no objection on your part and pip it were the great wish of your hart
<s> it was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he ought to speak to miss havisham
<s> the more i made faces and gestures to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he persisted in being to me
<s> have you brought his indentures with you asked miss havisham
<s> well pip you know replied joe as if that were a little unreasonable you yourself see me put em in my at and therefore you know as they are here
<s> with which he took them out and gave them not to miss havisham but to me
<s> i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good fellow i know i was ashamed of him when i saw that estella stood at the back of miss havisham s chair and that her eyes laughed mischievously
<s> i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to miss havisham
<s> you expected said miss havisham as she looked them over no premium with the boy
<s> joe i remonstrated for he made no reply at all
<s> why don t you answer
<s> pip returned joe cutting me short as if he were hurt which i meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me and which you know the answer to be full well no
<s> you know it to be no pip and wherefore should i say it
<s> miss havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there and took up a little bag from the table beside her
<s> pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is
<s> there are five and twenty guineas in this bag
<s> give it to your master pip
<s> as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room joe even at this pass persisted in addressing me
<s> this is wery liberal on your part pip said joe and it is as such received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near nor nowheres
<s> and now old chap said joe conveying to me a sensation first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar expression were applied to miss havisham and now old chap may we do our duty may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another and by them which your liberal present have conweyed to be for the satisfaction of mind of them as never here joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words and from myself far be it these words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice
<s> good bye pip said miss havisham
<s> let them out estella
<s> am i to come again miss havisham i asked
<s> no
<s> gargery is your master now
<s> gargery one word
<s> thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to joe in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and that is his reward
<s> of course as an honest man you will expect no other and no more
<s> how joe got out of the room i have never been able to determine but i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went after him and laid hold of him
<s> in another minute we were outside the gate and it was locked and estella was gone
<s> when we stood in the daylight alone again joe backed up against a wall and said to me astonishing and there he remained so long saying astonishing at intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming back
<s> at length he prolonged his remark into pip i do assure you this is as ton ishing and so by degrees became conversational and able to walk away
<s> i have reason to think that joe s intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through and that on our way to pumblechook s he invented a subtle and deep design
<s> my reason is to be found in what took place in mr
<s> pumblechook s parlour where on our presenting ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman
<s> well cried my sister addressing us both at once
<s> and what s happened to you i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this i am sure i do
<s> miss havisham said joe with a fixed look at me like an effort of remembrance made it wery partick ler that we should give her were it compliments or respects pip
<s> compliments i said
<s> which that were my own belief answered joe her compliments to mrs
<s> j
<s> gargery
<s> much good they ll do me observed my sister but rather gratified too
<s> and wishing pursued joe with another fixed look at me like another effort of remembrance that the state of miss havisham s elth were sitch as would have allowed were it pip
<s> of her having the pleasure i added
<s> of ladies company said joe
<s> and drew a long breath
<s> well cried my sister with a mollified glance at mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> she might have had the politeness to send that message at first but it s better late than never
<s> and what did she give young rantipole here
<s> she giv him said joe nothing
<s> mrs
<s> joe was going to break out but joe went on
<s> what she giv said joe she giv to his friends
<s> and by his friends were her explanation i mean into the hands of his sister mrs
<s> j
<s> gargery
<s> them were her words mrs
<s> j
<s> gargery
<s> she mayn t have know d added joe with an appearance of reflection whether it were joe or jorge
<s> my sister looked at pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden arm chair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all about it beforehand
<s> and how much have you got asked my sister laughing
<s> positively laughing
<s> what would present company say to ten pound demanded joe
<s> they d say returned my sister curtly pretty well
<s> not too much but pretty well
<s> it s more than that then said joe
<s> that fearful impostor pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he rubbed the arms of his chair it s more than that mum
<s> why you don t mean to say began my sister
<s> yes i do mum said pumblechook but wait a bit
<s> go on joseph
<s> good in you go on
<s> what would present company say proceeded joe to twenty pound
<s> handsome would be the word returned my sister
<s> well then said joe it s more than twenty pound
<s> that abject hypocrite pumblechook nodded again and said with a patronizing laugh it s more than that mum
<s> good again follow her up joseph
<s> then to make an end of it said joe delightedly handing the bag to my sister it s five and twenty pound
<s> it s five and twenty pound mum echoed that basest of swindlers pumblechook rising to shake hands with her and it s no more than your merits as i said when my opinion was asked and i wish you joy of the money
<s> if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind
<s> now you see joseph and wife said pumblechook as he took me by the arm above the elbow i am one of them that always go right through with what they ve begun
<s> this boy must be bound out of hand
<s> that s my way
<s> bound out of hand
<s> goodness knows uncle pumblechook said my sister grasping the money we re deeply beholden to you
<s> never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler
<s> a pleasure s a pleasure all the world over
<s> but this boy you know we must have him bound
<s> i said i d see to it to tell you the truth
<s> the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to joe in the magisterial presence
<s> i say we went over but i was pushed over by pumblechook exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed it was the general impression in court that i had been taken red handed for as pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some people say what s he done and others he s a young un too but looks bad don t he one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage shop of fetters and entitled to be read in my cell
<s> the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a church and with people hanging over the pews looking on and with mighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chairs with folded arms or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading the newspapers and with some shining black portraits on the walls which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking plaster
<s> here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested and i was bound mr
<s> pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little preliminaries disposed of
<s> when we had come out again and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me we went back to pumblechook s
<s> and there my sister became so excited by the twenty five guineas that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue boar and that pumblechook must go over in his chaise cart and bring the hubbles and mr
<s> wopsle
<s> it was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day i passed
<s> for it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the minds of the whole company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment
<s> and to make it worse they all asked me from time to time in short whenever they had nothing else to do why i didn t enjoy myself and what could i possibly do then but say i was enjoying myself when i wasn t
<s> however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the most of it
<s> that swindling pumblechook exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hours or bad company or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks
<s> my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldn t let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up and told me to enjoy myself
<s> that rather late in the evening mr
<s> wopsle gave us collins s ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials underneath sent up their compliments and it wasn t the tumblers arms
<s> that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang o lady fair mr
<s> wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about everybody s private affairs that he was the man with his white locks flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going
<s> finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like joe s trade
<s> i had liked it once but once was not now
<s> chapter xiv
<s> it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home
<s> there may be black ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved but that it is a miserable thing i can testify
<s> home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sister s temper
<s> but joe had sanctified it and i had believed in it
<s> i had believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon i had believed in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls i had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence
<s> within a single year all this was changed
<s> now it was all coarse and common and i would not have had miss havisham and estella see it on any account
<s> how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault how much miss havisham s how much my sister s is now of no moment to me or to any one
<s> the change was made in me the thing was done
<s> well or ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done
<s> once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my shirt sleeves and go into the forge joe s prentice i should be distinguished and happy
<s> now the reality was in my hold i only felt that i was dusty with the dust of small coal and that i had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather
<s> there have been occasions in my later life i suppose as in most lives when i have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more
<s> never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to joe
<s> i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about the churchyard on sunday evenings when night was falling comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea
<s> i was quite as dejected on the first working day of my apprenticeship as in that after time but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to joe while my indentures lasted
<s> it is about the only thing i am glad to know of myself in that connection
<s> for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i proceed to add was joe s
<s> it was not because i was faithful but because joe was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor
<s> it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of industry but because joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry that i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain
<s> it is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest hearted duty doing man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has touched one s self in going by and i know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented joe and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me
<s> what i wanted who can say how can i say when i never knew what i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and commonest should lift up my eyes and see estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge
<s> i was haunted by the fear that she would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hands doing the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me
<s> often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for joe and we were singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss havisham s would seem to show me estella s face in the fire with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me often at such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were and would fancy that i saw her just drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last
<s> after that when we went in to supper the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of home than ever in my own ungracious breast
<s> chapter xv
<s> as i was getting too big for mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt s room my education under that preposterous female terminated
<s> not however until biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a half penny
<s> although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines
<s> when i went to lunnon town sirs
<s> too rul loo rul
<s> too rul loo rul
<s> wasn t i done very brown sirs
<s> too rul loo rul
<s> too rul loo rul
<s> still in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry
<s> in my hunger for information i made proposals to mr
<s> wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied
<s> as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay figure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways i soon declined that course of instruction though not until mr
<s> wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me
<s> whatever i acquired i tried to impart to joe
<s> this statement sounds so well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained
<s> i wanted to make joe less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my society and less open to estella s reproach
<s> the old battery out on the marshes was our place of study and a broken slate and a short piece of slate pencil were our educational implements to which joe always added a pipe of tobacco
<s> i never knew joe to remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my tuition any piece of information whatever
<s> yet he would smoke his pipe at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else even with a learned air as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely
<s> dear fellow i hope he did
<s> it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water
<s> whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss havisham and estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water line it was just the same
<s> miss havisham and estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque
<s> one sunday when joe greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of miss havisham and estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head
<s> joe said i don t you think i ought to make miss havisham a visit
<s> well pip returned joe slowly considering
<s> what for
<s> what for joe what is any visit made for
<s> there is some wisits p r aps said joe as for ever remains open to the question pip
<s> but in regard to wisiting miss havisham
<s> she might think you wanted something expected something of her
<s> don t you think i might say that i did not joe
<s> you might old chap said joe
<s> and she might credit it
<s> similarly she mightn t
<s> joe felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition
<s> you see pip joe pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss havisham done the handsome thing by you
<s> when miss havisham done the handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were all
<s> yes joe
<s> i heard her
<s> all joe repeated very emphatically
<s> yes joe
<s> i tell you i heard her
<s> which i meantersay pip it might be that her meaning were make a end on it as you was me to the north and you to the south keep in sunders
<s> i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more probable
<s> but joe
<s> yes old chap
<s> here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day of my being bound i have never thanked miss havisham or asked after her or shown that i remember her
<s> that s true pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four round and which i meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of hoofs
<s> i don t mean that sort of remembrance joe i don t mean a present
<s> but joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it
<s> or even said he if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front door or say a gross or two of shark headed screws for general use or some light fancy article such as a toasting fork when she took her muffins or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like
<s> i don t mean any present at all joe i interposed
<s> well said joe still harping on it as though i had particularly pressed it if i was yourself pip i wouldn t
<s> no i would not
<s> for what s a door chain when she s got one always up and shark headers is open to misrepresentations
<s> and if it was a toasting fork you d go into brass and do yourself no credit
<s> and the oncommonest workman can t show himself oncommon in a gridiron for a gridiron is a gridiron said joe steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave and you can t help yourself
<s> my dear joe i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat don t go on in that way
<s> i never thought of making miss havisham any present
<s> no pip joe assented as if he had been contending for that all along and what i say to you is you are right pip
<s> yes joe but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack just now if you would give me a half holiday to morrow i think i would go uptown and make a call on miss est havisham
<s> which her name said joe gravely ain t estavisham pip unless she have been rechris ened
<s> i know joe i know
<s> it was a slip of mine
<s> what do you think of it joe
<s> in brief joe thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of it
<s> but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favour received then this experimental trip should have no successor
<s> by these conditions i promised to abide
<s> now joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was orlick
<s> he pretended that his christian name was dolge a clear impossibility but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding
<s> he was a broadshouldered loose limbed swarthy fellow of great strength never in a hurry and always slouching
<s> he never even seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere accident and when he went to the jolly bargemen to eat his dinner or went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back
<s> he lodged at a sluice keeper s out on the marshes and on working days would come slouching from his hermitage with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back
<s> on sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluice gates or stood against ricks and barns
<s> he always slouched locomotively with his eyes on the ground and when accosted or otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a half resentful half puzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking
<s> this morose journeyman had no liking for me
<s> when i was very small and timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was necessary to make up the fire once in seven years with a live boy and that i might consider myself fuel
<s> when i became joe s prentice orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him howbeit he liked me still less
<s> not that he ever said anything or did anything openly importing hostility i only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came in out of time
<s> dolge orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded joe of my half holiday
<s> he said nothing at the moment for he and joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows but by and by he said leaning on his hammer
<s> now master sure you re not a going to favour only one of us
<s> if young pip has a half holiday do as much for old orlick
<s> i suppose he was about five and twenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person
<s> why what ll you do with a half holiday if you get it said joe
<s> what ll i do with it what ll he do with it i ll do as much with it as him said orlick
<s> as to pip he s going up town said joe
<s> well then as to old orlick he s a going up town retorted that worthy
<s> two can go up town
<s> tain t only one wot can go up town
<s> don t lose your temper said joe
<s> shall if i like growled orlick
<s> some and their uptowning now master come
<s> no favouring in this shop
<s> be a man
<s> the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a red hot bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it out as if it were i i thought and the sparks were my spirting blood and finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he again leaned on his hammer
<s> now master
<s> are you all right now demanded joe
<s> ah i am all right said gruff old orlick
<s> then as in general you stick to your work as well as most men said joe let it be a half holiday for all
<s> my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearing she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener and she instantly looked in at one of the windows
<s> like you you fool said she to joe giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that
<s> you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in that way
<s> i wish i was his master
<s> you d be everybody s master if you durst retorted orlick with an ill favoured grin
<s> let her alone said joe
<s> i d be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister beginning to work herself into a mighty rage
<s> and i couldn t be a match for the noodles without being a match for your master who s the dunder headed king of the noodles
<s> and i couldn t be a match for the rogues without being a match for you who are the blackest looking and the worst rogue between this and france
<s> now
<s> you re a foul shrew mother gargery growled the journeyman
<s> if that makes a judge of rogues you ought to be a good un
<s> let her alone will you said joe
<s> what did you say cried my sister beginning to scream
<s> what did you say what did that fellow orlick say to me pip what did he call me with my husband standing by oh oh oh each of these exclamations was a shriek and i must remark of my sister what is equally true of all the violent women i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it and became blindly furious by regular stages what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me oh hold me oh
<s> ah h h growled the journeyman between his teeth i d hold you if you was my wife
<s> i d hold you under the pump and choke it out of you
<s> i tell you let her alone said joe
<s> oh to hear him cried my sister with a clap of her hands and a scream together which was her next stage
<s> to hear the names he s giving me that orlick in my own house me a married woman with my husband standing by oh oh here my sister after a fit of clappings and screamings beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees and threw her cap off and pulled her hair down which were the last stages on her road to frenzy
<s> being by this time a perfect fury and a complete success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked
<s> what could the wretched joe do now after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and mrs
<s> joe and further whether he was man enough to come on old orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway so without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went at one another like two giants
<s> but if any man in that neighbourhood could stand uplong against joe i never saw the man
<s> orlick as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very soon among the coal dust and in no hurry to come out of it
<s> then joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible at the window but who had seen the fight first i think and who was carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in joe s hair
<s> then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars and then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such a lull namely that it was sunday and somebody was dead i went upstairs to dress myself
<s> 0132m
<s> when i came down again i found joe and orlick sweeping up without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of orlick s nostrils which was neither expressive nor ornamental
<s> a pot of beer had appeared from the jolly bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner
<s> the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on joe who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation that might do me good on the rampage pip and off the rampage pip such is life
<s> with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy i found myself again going to miss havisham s matters little here
<s> nor how i passed and repassed the gate many times before i could make up my mind to ring
<s> nor how i debated whether i should go away without ringing nor how i should undoubtedly have gone if my time had been my own to come back
<s> miss sarah pocket came to the gate
<s> no estella
<s> how then you here again said miss pocket
<s> what do you want
<s> when i said that i only came to see how miss havisham was sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business
<s> but unwilling to hazard the responsibility she let me in and presently brought the sharp message that i was to come up
<s> everything was unchanged and miss havisham was alone
<s> well said she fixing her eyes upon me
<s> i hope you want nothing you ll get nothing
<s> no indeed miss havisham
<s> i only wanted you to know that i am doing very well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to you
<s> there there with the old restless fingers
<s> come now and then come on your birthday
<s> ay she cried suddenly turning herself and her chair towards me you are looking round for estella hey
<s> i had been looking round in fact for estella and i stammered that i hoped she was well
<s> abroad said miss havisham educating for a lady far out of reach prettier than ever admired by all who see her
<s> do you feel that you have lost her
<s> there was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that i was at a loss what to say
<s> she spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me
<s> when the gate was closed upon me by sarah of the walnut shell countenance i felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything and that was all i took by that motion
<s> as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at the shop windows and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman who should come out of the bookshop but mr
<s> wopsle
<s> mr
<s> wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea
<s> no sooner did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me and insisted on my accompanying him to the pumblechookian parlour
<s> as i knew it would be miserable at home and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better than none i made no great resistance consequently we turned into pumblechook s just as the street and the shops were lighting up
<s> as i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i don t know how long it may usually take but i know very well that it took until half past nine o clock that night and that when mr
<s> wopsle got into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career
<s> i thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all as if he had not been running to seed leaf after leaf ever since his course began
<s> this however was a mere question of length and wearisomeness
<s> what stung me was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self
<s> when barnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively apologetic pumblechook s indignant stare so taxed me with it
<s> wopsle too took pains to present me in the worst light
<s> at once ferocious and maudlin i was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever millwood put me down in argument on every occasion it became sheer monomania in my master s daughter to care a button for me and all i can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning is that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character
<s> even after i was happily hanged and wopsle had closed the book pumblechook sat staring at me and shaking his head and saying take warning boy take warning as if it were a well known fact that i contemplated murdering a near relation provided i could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor
<s> it was a very dark night when it was all over and when i set out with mr
<s> wopsle on the walk home
<s> beyond town we found a heavy mist out and it fell wet and thick
<s> the turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of the lamp s usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance on the fog
<s> we were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes when we came upon a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house
<s> halloa we said stopping
<s> orlick there
<s> ah he answered slouching out
<s> i was standing by a minute on the chance of company
<s> you are late i remarked
<s> orlick not unnaturally answered well and you re late
<s> we have been said mr
<s> wopsle exalted with his late performance we have been indulging mr
<s> orlick in an intellectual evening
<s> old orlick growled as if he had nothing to say about that and we all went on together
<s> i asked him presently whether he had been spending his half holiday up and down town
<s> yes said he all of it
<s> i come in behind yourself
<s> i didn t see you but i must have been pretty close behind you
<s> by the by the guns is going again
<s> at the hulks said i
<s> ay there s some of the birds flown from the cages
<s> the guns have been going since dark about
<s> you ll hear one presently
<s> in effect we had not walked many yards further when the well remembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives
<s> a good night for cutting off in said orlick
<s> we d be puzzled how to bring down a jail bird on the wing to night
<s> the subject was a suggestive one to me and i thought about it in silence
<s> mr
<s> wopsle as the ill requited uncle of the evening s tragedy fell to meditating aloud in his garden at camberwell
<s> orlick with his hands in his pockets slouched heavily at my side
<s> it was very dark very wet very muddy and so we splashed along
<s> now and then the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river
<s> i kept myself to myself and my thoughts
<s> mr
<s> wopsle died amiably at camberwell and exceedingly game on bosworth field and in the greatest agonies at glastonbury
<s> orlick sometimes growled beat it out beat it out old clem with a clink for the stout old clem i thought he had been drinking but he was not drunk
<s> thus we came to the village
<s> the way by which we approached it took us past the three jolly bargemen which we were surprised to find it being eleven o clock in a state of commotion with the door wide open and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about
<s> mr
<s> wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter surmising that a convict had been taken but came running out in a great hurry
<s> there s something wrong said he without stopping up at your place pip
<s> run all
<s> what is it i asked keeping up with him
<s> so did orlick at my side
<s> i can t quite understand
<s> the house seems to have been violently entered when joe gargery was out
<s> supposed by convicts
<s> somebody has been attacked and hurt
<s> we were running too fast to admit of more being said and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen
<s> it was full of people the whole village was there or in the yard and there was a surgeon and there was joe and there were a group of women all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen
<s> the unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me and so i became aware of my sister lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire destined never to be on the rampage again while she was the wife of joe
<s> chapter xvi
<s> with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else
<s> but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides i took another view of the case which was more reasonable
<s> joe had been at the three jolly bargemen smoking his pipe from a quarter after eight o clock to a quarter before ten
<s> while he was there my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged good night with a farm labourer going home
<s> the man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine
<s> when joe went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down on the floor and promptly called in assistance
<s> the fire had not then burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long the candle however had been blown out
<s> nothing had been taken away from any part of the house
<s> neither beyond the blowing out of the candle which stood on a table between the door and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck was there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such as she herself had made in falling and bleeding
<s> but there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot
<s> she had been struck with something blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence as she lay on her face
<s> and on the ground beside her when joe picked her up was a convict s leg iron which had been filed asunder
<s> now joe examining this iron with a smith s eye declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago
<s> the hue and cry going off to the hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron joe s opinion was corroborated
<s> they did not undertake to say when it had left the prison ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night
<s> further one of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron
<s> knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here
<s> i believed the iron to be my convict s iron the iron i had seen and heard him filing at on the marshes but my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use
<s> for i believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account
<s> either orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file
<s> now as to orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the evening he had been in divers companies in several public houses and he had come back with myself and mr
<s> wopsle
<s> there was nothing against him save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with everybody else about her ten thousand times
<s> as to the strange man if he had come back for his two bank notes there could have been no dispute about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them
<s> besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look round
<s> it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise
<s> i suffered unspeakable trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell joe all the story
<s> for months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the negative and reopened and reargued it next morning
<s> the contention came after all to this the secret was such an old one now had so grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it away
<s> in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate joe from me if he believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal cutlets as a monstrous invention
<s> however i temporized with myself of course for was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always done and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant
<s> the constables and the bow street men from london for this happened in the days of the extinct red waistcoated police were about the house for a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases
<s> they took up several obviously wrong people and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances
<s> also they stood about the door of the jolly bargemen with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as taking the culprit
<s> but not quite for they never did it
<s> long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very ill in bed
<s> her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her speech was unintelligible
<s> when at last she came round so far as to be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech
<s> as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent speller and as joe was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve
<s> the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of tea for joe and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own mistakes
<s> however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient
<s> a tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three months she would often put her hands to her head and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind
<s> we were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us
<s> mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a part of our establishment
<s> it may have been about a month after my sister s reappearance in the kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household
<s> above all she was a blessing to joe for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me every now and then and say with his blue eyes moistened such a fine figure of a woman as she once were pip biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life and to get down to the jolly bargemen now and then for a change that did him good
<s> it was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor joe though he never knew it and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered
<s> biddy s first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me
<s> i had tried hard at it but had made nothing of it
<s> thus it was
<s> again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted
<s> i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub
<s> at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sister s ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent
<s> thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail
<s> then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence
<s> but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck
<s> when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate
<s> biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me
<s> why of course cried biddy with an exultant face
<s> don t you see it s him
<s> orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer
<s> we told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him
<s> i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result
<s> she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink
<s> she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master
<s> after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlick s slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it
<s> chapter xvii
<s> i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to miss havisham
<s> i found miss sarah pocket still on duty at the gate i found miss havisham just as i had left her and she spoke of estella in the very same way if not in the very same words
<s> the interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was going and told me to come again on my next birthday
<s> i may mention at once that this became an annual custom
<s> i tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily if i expected more then and after that i took it
<s> so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing table glass that i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew older it stood still
<s> daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact
<s> it bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home
<s> imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however
<s> her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean
<s> she was not beautiful she was common and could not be like estella but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet tempered
<s> she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty and very good
<s> it came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task i was poring at writing some passages from a book to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem and seeing biddy observant of what i was about
<s> i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down
<s> biddy said i how do you manage it either i am very stupid or you are very clever
<s> what is it that i manage i don t know returned biddy smiling
<s> she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising
<s> how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me i was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocket money for similar investment though i have no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price
<s> i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage
<s> no because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see me turning to at it
<s> but you never turn to at it biddy
<s> i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing
<s> pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl
<s> for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools
<s> in short whatever i knew biddy knew
<s> theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better
<s> you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every chance
<s> you never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are
<s> biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing
<s> i was your first teacher though wasn t i said she as she sewed
<s> biddy i exclaimed in amazement
<s> why you are crying
<s> no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing
<s> what put that in your head
<s> what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people
<s> i recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered
<s> i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course
<s> biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy
<s> i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence
<s> yes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this in this kitchen
<s> ah poor thing replied biddy
<s> it was like her self forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable that s sadly true
<s> well said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do
<s> and i must consult you a little more as i used to do
<s> let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat
<s> my sister was never left alone now but joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out together
<s> it was summer time and lovely weather
<s> when we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to combine miss havisham and estella with the prospect in my usual way
<s> when we came to the river side and sat down on the bank with the water rippling at our feet making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of biddy into my inner confidence
<s> biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a gentleman
<s> o i wouldn t if i was you she returned
<s> i don t think it would answer
<s> biddy said i with some severity i have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman
<s> you know best pip but don t you think you are happier as you are
<s> biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am
<s> i am disgusted with my calling and with my life
<s> i have never taken to either since i was bound
<s> don t be absurd
<s> was i absurd said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows i am sorry for that i didn t mean to be
<s> i only want you to do well and to be comfortable
<s> well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be comfortable or anything but miserable there biddy unless i can lead a very different sort of life from the life i lead now
<s> that s a pity said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air
<s> now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own
<s> i told her she was right and i knew it was much to be regretted but still it was not to be helped
<s> if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall if i could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was little i know it would have been much better for me
<s> you and i and joe would have wanted nothing then and joe and i would perhaps have gone partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine sunday quite different people
<s> i should have been good enough for you shouldn t i biddy
<s> biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for answer yes i am not over particular
<s> it scarcely sounded flattering but i knew she meant well
<s> instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two see how i am going on
<s> dissatisfied and uncomfortable and what would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me so
<s> biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships
<s> it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she remarked directing her eyes to the ships again
<s> who said it
<s> i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where i was going to
<s> it was not to be shuffled off now however and i answered the beautiful young lady at miss havisham s and she s more beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want to be a gentleman on her account
<s> having made this lunatic confession i began to throw my torn up grass into the river as if i had some thoughts of following it
<s> do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over biddy quietly asked me after a pause
<s> i don t know i moodily answered
<s> because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should think but you know best that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words
<s> and if it is to gain her over i should think but you know best she was not worth gaining over
<s> exactly what i myself had thought many times
<s> exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment
<s> but how could i a poor dazed village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day
<s> it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her dreadfully
<s> in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well
<s> all the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced that i was quite conscious it would have served my face right if i had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot
<s> biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me
<s> she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work upon my hands one after another and gently took them out of my hair
<s> then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face upon my sleeve i cried a little exactly as i had done in the brewery yard and felt vaguely convinced that i was very much ill used by somebody or by everybody i can t say which
<s> i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt you could give me your confidence pip
<s> and i am glad of another thing and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it
<s> if your first teacher dear such a poor one and so much in need of being taught herself had been your teacher at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set
<s> but it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and it s of no use now
<s> so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a little farther or go home
<s> biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving her a kiss i shall always tell you everything
<s> till you re a gentleman said biddy
<s> you know i never shall be so that s always
<s> not that i have any occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i know as i told you at home the other night
<s> ah said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships
<s> and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a little farther or go home
<s> i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very beautiful
<s> i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and wholesomely situated after all in these circumstances than playing beggar my neighbour by candle light in the room with the stopped clocks and being despised by estella
<s> i thought it would be very good for me if i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do and stick to it and make the best of it
<s> i asked myself the question whether i did not surely know that if estella were beside me at that moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable i was obliged to admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself pip what a fool you are
<s> we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed right
<s> biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy to day and somebody else to morrow she would have derived only pain and no pleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine
<s> how could it be then that i did not like her much the better of the two
<s> biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me right
<s> i wish i could said biddy
<s> if i could only get myself to fall in love with you you don t mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance
<s> oh dear not at all said biddy
<s> don t mind me
<s> if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me
<s> but you never will you see said biddy
<s> it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before
<s> i therefore observed i was not quite sure of that
<s> but biddy said she was and she said it decisively
<s> in my heart i believed her to be right and yet i took it rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point
<s> when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and get over a stile near a sluice gate
<s> there started up from the gate or from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way old orlick
<s> halloa he growled where are you two going
<s> where should we be going but home
<s> well then said he i m jiggered if i don t see you home
<s> this penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of his
<s> he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and convey an idea of something savagely damaging
<s> when i was younger i had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook
<s> biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper don t let him come i don t like him
<s> as i did not like him either i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didn t want seeing home
<s> he received that piece of information with a yell of laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little distance
<s> curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account i asked her why she did not like him
<s> oh she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us because i i am afraid he likes me
<s> did he ever tell you he liked you i asked indignantly
<s> no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me so but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye
<s> however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation
<s> i was very hot indeed upon old orlick s daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on myself
<s> but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly
<s> no biddy it makes no difference to me only i don t like it i don t approve of it
<s> nor i neither said biddy
<s> though that makes no difference to you
<s> exactly said i but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you biddy if he danced at you with your own consent
<s> i kept an eye on orlick after that night and whenever circumstances were favourable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that demonstration
<s> he had struck root in joe s establishment by reason of my sister s sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him dismissed
<s> he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i had reason to know thereafter
<s> and now because my mind was not confused enough before i complicated its confusion fifty thousand fold by having states and seasons when i was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than estella and that the plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of self respect and happiness
<s> at those times i would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old joe and the forge was gone and that i was growing up in a fair way to be partners with joe and to keep company with biddy when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter my wits again
<s> scattered wits take a long time picking up and often before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out
<s> if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities i dare say
<s> it never did run out however but was brought to a premature end as i proceed to relate
<s> chapter xviii
<s> it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to joe and it was a saturday night
<s> there was a group assembled round the fire at the three jolly bargemen attentive to mr
<s> wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud
<s> of that group i was one
<s> a highly popular murder had been committed and mr
<s> wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows
<s> he gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description and identified himself with every witness at the inquest
<s> he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he barbarously bellowed i ll serve you out as the murderer
<s> he gave the medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner and he piped and shook as the aged turnpike keeper who had heard blows to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness
<s> the coroner in mr
<s> wopsle s hands became timon of athens the beadle coriolanus
<s> he enjoyed himself thoroughly and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable
<s> in this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder
<s> then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me looking on
<s> there was an expression of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces
<s> well said the stranger to mr
<s> wopsle when the reading was done you have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt
<s> everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer
<s> he looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically
<s> guilty of course said he
<s> out with it
<s> come
<s> sir returned mr
<s> wopsle without having the honour of your acquaintance i do say guilty
<s> upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur
<s> i know you do said the stranger i knew you would
<s> i told you so
<s> but now i ll ask you a question
<s> do you know or do you not know that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is proved proved to be guilty
<s> sir mr
<s> wopsle began to reply as an englishman myself i
<s> come said the stranger biting his forefinger at him
<s> don t evade the question
<s> either you know it or you don t know it
<s> which is it to be
<s> he stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at mr
<s> wopsle as it were to mark him out before biting it again
<s> now said he
<s> do you know it or don t you know it
<s> certainly i know it replied mr
<s> wopsle
<s> certainly you know it
<s> then why didn t you say so at first now i ll ask you another question taking possession of mr
<s> wopsle as if he had a right to him do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross examined
<s> mr
<s> wopsle was beginning i can only say when the stranger stopped him
<s> what you won t answer the question yes or no now i ll try you again
<s> throwing his finger at him again
<s> attend to me
<s> are you aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been cross examined come i only want one word from you
<s> yes or no
<s> mr
<s> wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him
<s> come said the stranger i ll help you
<s> you don t deserve help but i ll help you
<s> look at that paper you hold in your hand
<s> what is it
<s> what is it repeated mr
<s> wopsle eyeing it much at a loss
<s> is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner the printed paper you have just been reading from
<s> undoubtedly
<s> undoubtedly
<s> now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence
<s> i read that just now mr
<s> wopsle pleaded
<s> never mind what you read just now sir i don t ask you what you read just now
<s> you may read the lord s prayer backwards if you like and perhaps have done it before to day
<s> turn to the paper
<s> no no no my friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to the bottom to the bottom
<s> we all began to think mr
<s> wopsle full of subterfuge
<s> well have you found it
<s> here it is said mr
<s> wopsle
<s> now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence come do you make that of it
<s> mr
<s> wopsle answered those are not the exact words
<s> not the exact words repeated the gentleman bitterly
<s> is that the exact substance
<s> yes said mr
<s> wopsle
<s> yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness wopsle
<s> and now i ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage before his eyes can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellow creature guilty unheard
<s> we all began to suspect that mr
<s> wopsle was not the man we had thought him and that he was beginning to be found out
<s> and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his finger at mr
<s> wopsle heavily that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help him god
<s> we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate wopsle had gone too far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time
<s> the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right
<s> from information i have received said he looking round at us as we all quailed before him i have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you by name joseph or joe gargery
<s> which is the man
<s> here is the man said joe
<s> the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and joe went
<s> you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as pip is he here
<s> i am here i cried
<s> the stranger did not recognise me but i recognised him as the gentleman i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss havisham
<s> i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the settle and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his deep set eyes his bushy black eyebrows his large watch chain his strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand
<s> i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had surveyed me at his leisure
<s> it will take a little time
<s> perhaps we had better go to your place of residence
<s> i prefer not to anticipate my communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards i have nothing to do with that
<s> amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly bargemen and in a wondering silence walked home
<s> while going along the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of his finger
<s> as we neared home joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door
<s> our conference was held in the state parlour which was feebly lighted by one candle
<s> it began with the strange gentleman s sitting down at the table drawing the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocket book
<s> he then put up the pocket book and set the candle a little aside after peering round it into the darkness at joe and me to ascertain which was which
<s> my name he said is jaggers and i am a lawyer in london
<s> i am pretty well known
<s> i have unusual business to transact with you and i commence by explaining that it is not of my originating
<s> if my advice had been asked i should not have been here
<s> it was not asked and you see me here
<s> what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i do
<s> no less no more
<s> finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground
<s> now joseph gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice
<s> you would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good you would want nothing for so doing
<s> lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in pip s way said joe staring
<s> lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned mr
<s> jaggers
<s> the question is would you want anything do you want anything
<s> the answer is returned joe sternly no
<s> i thought mr
<s> jaggers glanced at joe as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness
<s> but i was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise to be sure of it
<s> very well said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> recollect the admission you have made and don t try to go from it presently
<s> who s a going to try retorted joe
<s> i don t say anybody is
<s> do you keep a dog
<s> yes i do keep a dog
<s> bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better
<s> bear that in mind will you repeated mr
<s> jaggers shutting his eyes and nodding his head at joe as if he were forgiving him something
<s> now i return to this young fellow
<s> and the communication i have got to make is that he has great expectations
<s> joe and i gasped and looked at one another
<s> i am instructed to communicate to him said mr
<s> jaggers throwing his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property
<s> further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place and be brought up as a gentleman in a word as a young fellow of great expectations
<s> my dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality miss havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale
<s> now mr
<s> pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have to say to you
<s> you are to understand first that it is the request of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear the name of pip
<s> you will have no objection i dare say to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition
<s> but if you have any objection this is the time to mention it
<s> my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears that i could scarcely stammer i had no objection
<s> i should think not now you are to understand secondly mr
<s> pip that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret until the person chooses to reveal it
<s> i am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself
<s> when or where that intention may be carried out i cannot say no one can say
<s> it may be years hence
<s> now you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the communications you may have with me
<s> if you have a suspicion in your own breast keep that suspicion in your own breast
<s> it is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are they may be the strongest and gravest reasons or they may be mere whim
<s> this is not for you to inquire into
<s> the condition is laid down
<s> your acceptance of it and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions and for whom i am not otherwise responsible
<s> that person is the person from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by that person and by me
<s> again not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it this is the time to mention it
<s> speak out
<s> once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection
<s> i should think not now mr
<s> pip i have done with stipulations
<s> though he called me mr
<s> pip and began rather to make up to me he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement if he only chose to mention them
<s> we come next to mere details of arrangement
<s> you must know that although i have used the term expectations more than once you are not endowed with expectations only
<s> there is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance
<s> you will please consider me your guardian
<s> oh for i was going to thank him i tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldn t render them
<s> it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage
<s> i said i had always longed for it
<s> never mind what you have always longed for mr
<s> pip he retorted keep to the record
<s> if you long for it now that s enough
<s> am i answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor is that it
<s> i stammered yes that was it
<s> good
<s> now your inclinations are to be consulted
<s> i don t think that wise mind but it s my trust
<s> have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another
<s> i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt so i replied in the negative
<s> there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think might suit the purpose said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> i don t recommend him observe because i never recommend anybody
<s> the gentleman i speak of is one mr
<s> matthew pocket
<s> ah i caught at the name directly
<s> miss havisham s relation
<s> the matthew whom mr
<s> and mrs
<s> camilla had spoken of
<s> the matthew whose place was to be at miss havisham s head when she lay dead in her bride s dress on the bride s table
<s> you know the name said mr
<s> jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer
<s> my answer was that i had heard of the name
<s> oh said he
<s> you have heard of the name
<s> but the question is what do you say of it
<s> i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation
<s> no my young friend he interrupted shaking his great head very slowly
<s> recollect yourself
<s> not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation
<s> no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once no no no it s very well done but it won t do you are too young to fix me with it
<s> recommendation is not the word mr
<s> pip
<s> try another
<s> correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention of mr
<s> matthew pocket
<s> that s more like it cried mr
<s> jaggers
<s> and i added i would gladly try that gentleman
<s> good
<s> you had better try him in his own house
<s> the way shall be prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london
<s> when will you come to london
<s> i said glancing at joe who stood looking on motionless that i supposed i could come directly
<s> first said mr
<s> jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in and they should not be working clothes
<s> say this day week
<s> you ll want some money
<s> shall i leave you twenty guineas
<s> he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me
<s> this was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair
<s> he sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing joe
<s> well joseph gargery you look dumbfoundered
<s> i am said joe in a very decided manner
<s> it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember
<s> it were understood said joe
<s> and it are understood
<s> and it ever will be similar according
<s> but what said mr
<s> jaggers swinging his purse what if it was in my instructions to make you a present as compensation
<s> as compensation what for joe demanded
<s> for the loss of his services
<s> joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman
<s> i have often thought him since like the steam hammer that can crush a man or pat an egg shell in his combination of strength with gentleness
<s> pip is that hearty welcome said joe to go free with his services to honour and fortun as no words can tell him
<s> but if you think as money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child what come to the forge and ever the best of friends
<s> o dear good joe whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i see you again with your muscular blacksmith s arm before your eyes and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away
<s> o dear good faithful tender joe i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel s wing
<s> but i encouraged joe at the time
<s> i was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes and could not retrace the by paths we had trodden together
<s> i begged joe to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best of friends and as i said we ever would be so
<s> joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but said not another word
<s> mr
<s> jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognised in joe the village idiot and in me his keeper
<s> when it was over he said weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing
<s> now joseph gargery i warn you this is your last chance
<s> no half measures with me
<s> if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge to make you speak out and you shall have it
<s> if on the contrary you mean to say here to his great amazement he was stopped by joe s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose
<s> which i meantersay cried joe that if you come into my place bull baiting and badgering me come out which i meantersay as sech if you re a man come on which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay and stand or fall by
<s> i drew joe away and he immediately became placable merely stating to me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern that he were not a going to be bull baited and badgered in his own place
<s> mr
<s> jaggers had risen when joe demonstrated and had backed near the door
<s> without evincing any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory remarks
<s> they were these
<s> well mr
<s> pip i think the sooner you leave here as you are to be a gentleman the better
<s> let it stand for this day week and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime
<s> you can take a hackney coach at the stage coach office in london and come straight to me
<s> understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust i undertake
<s> i am paid for undertaking it and i do so
<s> now understand that finally
<s> understand that
<s> he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone on but for his seeming to think joe dangerous and going off
<s> something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was going down to the jolly bargemen where he had left a hired carriage
<s> i beg your pardon mr
<s> jaggers
<s> halloa said he facing round what s the matter
<s> i wish to be quite right mr
<s> jaggers and to keep to your directions so i thought i had better ask
<s> would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one i know about here before i go away
<s> no said he looking as if he hardly understood me
<s> i don t mean in the village only but up town
<s> no said he
<s> no objection
<s> i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the burning coals
<s> i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals and nothing was said for a long time
<s> my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her needle work before the fire and joe sat next biddy and i sat next joe in the corner opposite my sister
<s> the more i looked into the glowing coals the more incapable i became of looking at joe the longer the silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak
<s> at length i got out joe have you told biddy
<s> no pip returned joe still looking at the fire and holding his knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere which i left it to yourself pip
<s> i would rather you told joe
<s> pip s a gentleman of fortun then said joe and god bless him in it
<s> biddy dropped her work and looked at me
<s> joe held his knees and looked at me
<s> i looked at both of them
<s> after a pause they both heartily congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that i rather resented
<s> i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy joe with the grave obligation i considered my friends under to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune
<s> it would all come out in good time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron
<s> biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again and said she would be very particular and joe still detaining his knees said ay ay i ll be ekervally partickler pip and then they congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that i didn t half like it
<s> infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened
<s> to the best of my belief those efforts entirely failed
<s> she laughed and nodded her head a great many times and even repeated after biddy the words pip and property
<s> but i doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind
<s> i never could have believed it without experience but as joe and biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy
<s> dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be but it is possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied with myself
<s> anyhow i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and about what they should do without me and all that
<s> and whenever i caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they often looked at me particularly biddy i felt offended as if they were expressing some mistrust of me
<s> though heaven knows they never did by word or sign
<s> at those times i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evenings to air the room
<s> the very stars to which i then raised my eyes i am afraid i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which i had passed my life
<s> saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer
<s> five more days and then the day before the day they ll soon go
<s> yes pip observed joe whose voice sounded hollow in his beer mug
<s> they ll soon go
<s> soon soon go said biddy
<s> i have been thinking joe that when i go down town on monday and order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that i ll come and put them on there or that i ll have them sent to mr
<s> pumblechook s
<s> it would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here
<s> mr
<s> and mrs
<s> hubble might like to see you in your new gen teel figure too pip said joe industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices
<s> so might wopsle
<s> and the jolly bargemen might take it as a compliment
<s> that s just what i don t want joe
<s> they would make such a business of it such a coarse and common business that i couldn t bear myself
<s> ah that indeed pip said joe
<s> if you couldn t abear yourself
<s> biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sister s plate have you thought about when you ll show yourself to mr
<s> gargery and your sister and me you will show yourself to us won t you
<s> biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick that it s difficult to keep up with you
<s> she always were quick observed joe
<s> if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening most likely on the evening before i go away
<s> biddy said no more
<s> handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and joe and went up to bed
<s> when i got into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for ever
<s> it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which i was going as i had been in so often between the forge and miss havisham s and biddy and estella
<s> the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and the room was warm
<s> as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw joe come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two in the air and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light it for him
<s> he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting for some reason or other
<s> he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once
<s> i would not have listened for more if i could have heard more so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever known
<s> looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from joe s pipe floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from joe not obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared together
<s> i put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more
<s> chapter xix
<s> morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same
<s> what lay heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure for i could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone
<s> joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our approaching separation but they only referred to it when i did
<s> after breakfast joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free
<s> with all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with joe and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all
<s> after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off the marshes at once and get them done with
<s> as i passed the church i felt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after sunday all their lives through and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds
<s> i promised myself that i would do something for them one of these days and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast beef and plum pudding a pint of ale and a gallon of condescension upon everybody in the village
<s> if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those graves what were my thoughts on this sunday when the place recalled the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge my comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might be veritably dead into the bargain
<s> no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these grazing cattle though they seemed in their dull manner to wear a more respectful air now and to face round in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations farewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood henceforth i was for london and greatness not for smith s work in general and for you i made my exultant way to the old battery and lying down there to consider the question whether miss havisham intended me for estella fell asleep
<s> when i awoke i was much surprised to find joe sitting beside me smoking his pipe
<s> he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes and said
<s> as being the last time pip i thought i d foller
<s> and joe i am very glad you did so
<s> thankee pip
<s> you may be sure dear joe i went on after we had shaken hands that i shall never forget you
<s> no no pip said joe in a comfortable tone i m sure of that
<s> ay ay old chap bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in a man s mind to be certain on it
<s> but it took a bit of time to get it well round the change come so oncommon plump didn t it
<s> somehow i was not best pleased with joe s being so mightily secure of me
<s> i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said it does you credit pip or something of that sort
<s> therefore i made no remark on joe s first head merely saying as to his second that the tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i were one
<s> have you though said joe
<s> astonishing
<s> it s a pity now joe said i that you did not get on a little more when we had our lessons here isn t it
<s> well i don t know returned joe
<s> i m so awful dull
<s> i m only master of my own trade
<s> it were always a pity as i was so awful dull but it s no more of a pity now than it was this day twelvemonth don t you see
<s> what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to do something for joe it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station
<s> he was so perfectly innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to biddy in preference
<s> so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget her said i had a favour to ask of her
<s> and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of helping joe on a little
<s> how helping him on asked biddy with a steady sort of glance
<s> well joe is a dear good fellow in fact i think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived but he is rather backward in some things
<s> for instance biddy in his learning and his manners
<s> although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her eyes very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me
<s> o his manners won t his manners do then asked biddy plucking a black currant leaf
<s> my dear biddy they do very well here
<s> o they do very well here interrupted biddy looking closely at the leaf in her hand
<s> hear me out but if i were to remove joe into a higher sphere as i shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would hardly do him justice
<s> and don t you think he knows that asked biddy
<s> it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me that i said snappishly
<s> biddy what do you mean
<s> biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands and the smell of a black currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane said have you never considered that he may be proud
<s> proud i repeated with disdainful emphasis
<s> o there are many kinds of pride said biddy looking full at me and shaking her head pride is not all of one kind
<s> well what are you stopping for said i
<s> not all of one kind resumed biddy
<s> he may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well and with respect
<s> to tell you the truth i think he is though it sounds bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do
<s> now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you
<s> i did not expect to see this in you
<s> you are envious biddy and grudging
<s> you are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you can t help showing it
<s> if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so
<s> say so over and over again if you have the heart to think so
<s> if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous and superior tone don t put it off upon me
<s> i am very sorry to see it and it s a it s a bad side of human nature
<s> i did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of improving dear joe
<s> but after this i ask you nothing
<s> i am extremely sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated
<s> it s a it s a bad side of human nature
<s> whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here at all times
<s> and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make no difference in my remembrance of you
<s> yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither said biddy turning away her head
<s> i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy and biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper time again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first
<s> but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to biddy and we dropped the subject
<s> putting on the best clothes i had i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open and presented myself before mr
<s> trabb the tailor who was having his breakfast in the parlour behind his shop and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me but called me in to him
<s> well said mr
<s> trabb in a hail fellow well met kind of way
<s> how are you and what can i do for you
<s> mr
<s> trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather beds and was slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up
<s> he was a prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags
<s> mr
<s> trabb said i it s an unpleasant thing to have to mention because it looks like boasting but i have come into a handsome property
<s> a change passed over mr
<s> trabb
<s> he forgot the butter in bed got up from the bedside and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth exclaiming lord bless my soul
<s> i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them and i want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in
<s> i wish to pay for them i added otherwise i thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money
<s> my dear sir said mr
<s> trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened his arms and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow don t hurt me by mentioning that
<s> may i venture to congratulate you would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop
<s> mr
<s> trabb s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country side
<s> when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his labours by sweeping over me
<s> he was still sweeping when i came out into the shop with mr
<s> trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with any blacksmith alive or dead
<s> hold that noise said mr
<s> trabb with the greatest sternness or i ll knock your head off do me the favour to be seated sir
<s> now this said mr
<s> trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss is a very sweet article
<s> i can recommend it for your purpose sir because it really is extra super
<s> but you shall see some others
<s> give me number four you to the boy and with a dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreant s brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity
<s> mr
<s> trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again
<s> then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight
<s> and let me have none of your tricks here said mr
<s> trabb or you shall repent it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live
<s> mr
<s> trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that it would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow townsman s if he might claim me for a fellow townsman having worn
<s> are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said mr
<s> trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and bring them myself
<s> i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of mr
<s> trabb s judgment and re entered the parlour to be measured
<s> for although mr
<s> trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented with it he said apologetically that it wouldn t do under existing circumstances sir wouldn t do at all
<s> so mr
<s> trabb measured and calculated me in the parlour as if i were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains
<s> when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to mr
<s> pumblechook s on the thursday evening he said with his hand upon the parlour lock i know sir that london gentlemen cannot be expected to patronise local work as a rule but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem it
<s> good morning sir much obliged
<s> door
<s> the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what it meant
<s> but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was that it had morally laid upon his back trabb s boy
<s> after this memorable event i went to the hatter s and the bootmaker s and the hosier s and felt rather like mother hubbard s dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades
<s> i also went to the coach office and took my place for seven o clock on saturday morning
<s> it was not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome property but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me
<s> when i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards pumblechook s and as i approached that gentleman s place of business i saw him standing at his door
<s> he was waiting for me with great impatience
<s> he had been out early with the chaise cart and had called at the forge and heard the news
<s> he had prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlour and he too ordered his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed
<s> my dear friend said mr
<s> pumblechook taking me by both hands when he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good fortune
<s> well deserved well deserved
<s> this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of expressing himself
<s> to think said mr
<s> pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for some moments that i should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this is a proud reward
<s> i begged mr
<s> pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted on that point
<s> my dear young friend said mr
<s> pumblechook if you will allow me to call you so
<s> i murmured certainly and mr
<s> pumblechook took me by both hands again and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional appearance though it was rather low down my dear young friend rely upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before the mind of joseph
<s> joseph said mr
<s> pumblechook in the way of a compassionate adjuration
<s> joseph joseph thereupon he shook his head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph
<s> but my dear young friend said mr
<s> pumblechook you must be hungry you must be exhausted
<s> be seated
<s> here is a chicken had round from the boar here is a tongue had round from the boar here s one or two little things had round from the boar that i hope you may not despise
<s> but do i said mr
<s> pumblechook getting up again the moment after he had sat down see afore me him as i ever sported with in his times of happy infancy and may i may i
<s> this may i meant might he shake hands i consented and he was fervent and then sat down again
<s> here is wine said mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> let us drink thanks to fortune and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment and yet i cannot said mr
<s> pumblechook getting up again see afore me one and likewise drink to one without again expressing may i may i
<s> i said he might and he shook hands with me again and emptied his glass and turned it upside down
<s> i did the same and if i had turned myself upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to my head
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of tongue none of those out of the way no thoroughfares of pork now and took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all
<s> ah poultry poultry you little thought said mr
<s> pumblechook apostrophising the fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for you
<s> you little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as call it a weakness if you will said mr
<s> pumblechook getting up again but may i may i
<s> it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so he did it at once
<s> how he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife i don t know
<s> and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had the honour of bringing you up by hand it s a sad picter to reflect that she s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour
<s> may
<s> i saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him
<s> we ll drink her health said i
<s> ah cried mr
<s> pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid with admiration that s the way you know em sir i don t know who sir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person present that s the way you know the noble minded sir ever forgiving and ever affable
<s> it might said the servile pumblechook putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person have the appearance of repeating but may i
<s> when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister
<s> let us never be blind said mr
<s> pumblechook to her faults of temper but it is to be hoped she meant well
<s> at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting
<s> i mentioned to mr
<s> pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him
<s> i mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village and he lauded it to the skies
<s> there was nobody but himself he intimated worthy of my confidence and in short might he then he asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend if i had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea
<s> yet for all that i remember feeling convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a sensible practical good hearted prime fellow
<s> by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs
<s> he mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighbourhood
<s> what alone was wanting to the realisation of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital
<s> those were the two little words more capital
<s> now it appeared to him pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a sleeping partner sir which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine the books and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket to the tune of fifty per cent it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property which would be worthy of his attention
<s> but what did i think he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think i gave it as my opinion
<s> wait a bit the united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me but said he really must and did
<s> we drank all the wine and mr
<s> pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep joseph up to the mark i don t know what mark and to render me efficient and constant service i don t know what service
<s> he also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common fortun
<s> he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now and i said so too
<s> finally i went out into the air with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road
<s> there i was roused by mr
<s> pumblechook s hailing me
<s> he was a long way down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to stop
<s> i stopped and he came up breathless
<s> no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech
<s> not if i can help it
<s> this occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part
<s> may i as an old friend and well wisher may i
<s> we shook hands for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation
<s> then he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the road and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before i pursued my way home
<s> i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little i possessed was adapted to my new station
<s> but i began packing that same afternoon and wildly packed up things that i knew i should want next morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost
<s> so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed and on friday morning i went to mr
<s> pumblechook s to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to miss havisham
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook s own room was given up to me to dress in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event
<s> my clothes were rather a disappointment of course
<s> probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell a trifle short of the wearer s expectation
<s> but after i had had my new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of posturing with mr
<s> pumblechook s very limited dressing glass in the futile endeavour to see my legs it seemed to fit me better
<s> it being market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off mr
<s> pumblechook was not at home
<s> i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing
<s> this was all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a personal disadvantage something like joe s in his sunday suit
<s> i went circuitously to miss havisham s by all the back ways and rang at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves
<s> sarah pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed her walnut shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow
<s> you said she
<s> you good gracious what do you want
<s> i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say good bye to miss havisham
<s> i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went to ask if i were to be admitted
<s> after a very short delay she returned and took me up staring at me all the way
<s> miss havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table leaning on her crutch stick
<s> the room was lighted as of yore and at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned
<s> she was then just abreast of the rotted bride cake
<s> don t go sarah she said
<s> well pip
<s> i start for london miss havisham to morrow i was exceedingly careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you
<s> this is a gay figure pip said she making her crutch stick play round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were bestowing the finishing gift
<s> i have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss havisham i murmured
<s> and i am so grateful for it miss havisham
<s> ay ay said she looking at the discomfited and envious sarah with delight
<s> i have seen mr
<s> jaggers
<s> i have heard about it pip
<s> so you go to morrow
<s> yes miss havisham
<s> and you are adopted by a rich person
<s> yes miss havisham
<s> not named
<s> no miss havisham
<s> and mr
<s> jaggers is made your guardian
<s> yes miss havisham
<s> she quite gloated on these questions and answers so keen was her enjoyment of sarah pocket s jealous dismay
<s> well she went on you have a promising career before you
<s> be good deserve it and abide by mr
<s> jaggers s instructions
<s> she looked at me and looked at sarah and sarah s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile
<s> good bye pip you will always keep the name of pip you know
<s> yes miss havisham
<s> good bye pip
<s> she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to my lips
<s> i had not considered how i should take leave of her it came naturally to me at the moment to do this
<s> she looked at sarah pocket with triumph in her weird eyes and so i left my fairy godmother with both her hands on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride cake that was hidden in cobwebs
<s> sarah pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen out
<s> she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree confounded
<s> i said good bye miss pocket but she merely stared and did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken
<s> clear of the house i made the best of my way back to pumblechook s took off my new clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress carrying it to speak the truth much more at my ease too though i had the bundle to carry
<s> and now those six days which were to have run out so slowly had run out fast and were gone and to morrow looked me in the face more steadily than i could look at it
<s> as the six evenings had dwindled away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more appreciative of the society of joe and biddy
<s> on this last evening i dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my splendour until bedtime
<s> we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with
<s> we were all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits
<s> i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little hand portmanteau and i had told joe that i wished to walk away all alone
<s> i am afraid sore afraid that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and joe if we went to the coach together
<s> i had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement but when i went up to my little room on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat joe to walk with me in the morning
<s> i did not
<s> all night there were coaches in my broken sleep going to wrong places instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now pigs now men never horses
<s> fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing
<s> then i got up and partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in taking it fell asleep
<s> biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon
<s> but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go downstairs
<s> after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy called to me that i was late
<s> it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it
<s> i got up from the meal saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me well i suppose i must be off and then i kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed biddy and threw my arms around joe s neck
<s> then i took up my little portmanteau and walked out
<s> the last i saw of them was when i presently heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw joe throwing an old shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe
<s> i stopped then to wave my hat and dear old joe waved his strong right arm above his head crying huskily hooroar and biddy put her apron to her face
<s> i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high street
<s> i whistled and made nothing of going
<s> but the village was very peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave and sob i broke into tears
<s> it was by the finger post at the end of the village and i laid my hand upon it and said good bye o my dear dear friend
<s> heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard hearts
<s> i was better after i had cried than before more sorry more aware of my own ingratitude more gentle
<s> if i had cried before i should have had joe with me then
<s> so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at home and a better parting
<s> we changed and i had not made up my mind and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back when we changed again
<s> and while i was occupied with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to joe in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat high
<s> as if he could possibly be there
<s> we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to go back and i went on
<s> and the mists had all solemnly risen now and the world lay spread before me
<s> this is the end of the first stage of pip s expectations
<s> chapter xx
<s> the journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours
<s> it was a little past midday when the four horse stage coach by which i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the cross keys wood street cheapside london
<s> we britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything otherwise while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and dirty
<s> mr
<s> jaggers had duly sent me his address it was little britain and he had written after it on his card just out of smithfield and close by the coach office
<s> nevertheless a hackney coachman who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great coat as he was years old packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles
<s> his getting on his box which i remember to have been decorated with an old weather stained pea green hammercloth moth eaten into rags was quite a work of time
<s> it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged things behind for i don t know how many footmen to hold on by and a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation
<s> i had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw yard it was and yet how like a rag shop and to wonder why the horses nose bags were kept inside when i observed the coachman beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently
<s> and stop we presently did in a gloomy street at certain offices with an open door whereon was painted mr
<s> jaggers
<s> how much i asked the coachman
<s> the coachman answered a shilling unless you wish to make it more
<s> i naturally said i had no wish to make it more
<s> then it must be a shilling observed the coachman
<s> i don t want to get into trouble
<s> i know him he darkly closed an eye at mr
<s> jaggers s name and shook his head
<s> when he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his mind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked was mr
<s> jaggers at home
<s> he is not returned the clerk
<s> he is in court at present
<s> am i addressing mr
<s> pip
<s> i signified that he was addressing mr
<s> pip
<s> mr
<s> jaggers left word would you wait in his room
<s> he couldn t say how long he might be having a case on
<s> but it stands to reason his time being valuable that he won t be longer than he can help
<s> with those words the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back
<s> here we found a gentleman with one eye in a velveteen suit and knee breeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper
<s> go and wait outside mike said the clerk
<s> i began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone
<s> mr
<s> jaggers s room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal place the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it
<s> there were not so many papers about as i should have expected to see and there were some odd objects about that i should not have expected to see such as an old rusty pistol a sword in a scabbard several strange looking boxes and packages and two dreadful casts on a shelf of faces peculiarly swollen and twitchy about the nose
<s> mr
<s> jaggers s own high backed chair was of deadly black horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin and i fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at the clients
<s> the room was but small and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall the wall especially opposite to mr
<s> jaggers s chair being greasy with shoulders
<s> i recalled too that the one eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when i was the innocent cause of his being turned out
<s> i sat down in the cliental chair placed over against mr
<s> jaggers s chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place
<s> i called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else s disadvantage as his master had
<s> i wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow creatures
<s> i wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came there
<s> i wondered whether the two swollen faces were of mr
<s> jaggers s family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill looking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home
<s> of course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything
<s> but i sat wondering and waiting in mr
<s> jaggers s close room until i really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above mr
<s> jaggers s chair and got up and went out
<s> when i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i waited he advised me to go round the corner and i should come into smithfield
<s> so i came into smithfield and the shameful place being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me
<s> so i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where i saw the great black dome of saint paul s bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate prison
<s> following the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles and from this and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer i inferred that the trials were on
<s> while i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a trial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown whence i should command a full view of the lord chief justice in his wig and robes mentioning that awful personage like waxwork and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen pence
<s> as i declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtors door out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on em would come out at that door the day after to morrow at eight in the morning to be killed in a row
<s> this was horrible and gave me a sickening idea of london the more so as the lord chief justice s proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket handkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner
<s> under these circumstances i thought myself well rid of him for a shilling
<s> i dropped into the office to ask if mr
<s> jaggers had come in yet and i found he had not and i strolled out again
<s> this time i made the tour of little britain and turned into bartholomew close and now i became aware that other people were waiting about for mr
<s> jaggers as well as i
<s> there were two men of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew close and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when they first passed me that jaggers would do it if it was to be done
<s> there was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders jaggers is for him melia and what more could you have there was a red eyed little jew who came into the close while i was loitering there in company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand and while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a highly excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp post and accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the words o jaggerth jaggerth jaggerth all otherth ith cag maggerth give me jaggerth these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me and i admired and wondered more than ever
<s> at length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close into little britain i saw mr
<s> jaggers coming across the road towards me
<s> all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there was quite a rush at him
<s> mr
<s> jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed himself to his followers
<s> first he took the two secret men
<s> now i have nothing to say to you said mr
<s> jaggers throwing his finger at them
<s> i want to know no more than i know
<s> as to the result it s a toss up
<s> i told you from the first it was a toss up
<s> have you paid wemmick
<s> we made the money up this morning sir said one of the men submissively while the other perused mr
<s> jaggers s face
<s> i don t ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it up at all
<s> has wemmick got it
<s> yes sir said both the men together
<s> very well then you may go
<s> now i won t have it said mr jaggers waving his hand at them to put them behind him
<s> if you say a word to me i ll throw up the case
<s> we thought mr
<s> jaggers one of the men began pulling off his hat
<s> that s what i told you not to do said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> you thought i think for you that s enough for you
<s> if i want you i know where to find you i don t want you to find me
<s> now i won t have it
<s> i won t hear a word
<s> the two men looked at one another as mr
<s> jaggers waved them behind again and humbly fell back and were heard no more
<s> and now you said mr
<s> jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on the two women with the shawls from whom the three men had meekly separated oh amelia is it
<s> yes mr
<s> jaggers
<s> and do you remember retorted mr
<s> jaggers that but for me you wouldn t be here and couldn t be here
<s> o yes sir exclaimed both women together
<s> lord bless you sir well we knows that
<s> then why said mr
<s> jaggers do you come here
<s> my bill sir the crying woman pleaded
<s> now i tell you what said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> once for all
<s> if you don t know that your bill s in good hands i know it
<s> and if you come here bothering about your bill i ll make an example of both your bill and you and let him slip through my fingers
<s> have you paid wemmick
<s> o yes sir every farden
<s> very well
<s> then you have done all you have got to do
<s> say another word one single word and wemmick shall give you your money back
<s> this terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately
<s> no one remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the skirts of mr
<s> jaggers s coat to his lips several times
<s> i don t know this man said mr
<s> jaggers in the same devastating strain what does this fellow want
<s> ma thear mithter jaggerth
<s> hown brother to habraham latharuth
<s> who s he said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> let go of my coat
<s> the suitor kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it replied habraham latharuth on thuthpithion of plate
<s> you re too late said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> i am over the way
<s> holy father mithter jaggerth cried my excitable acquaintance turning white don t thay you re again habraham latharuth
<s> i am said mr
<s> jaggers and there s an end of it
<s> get out of the way
<s> mithter jaggerth half a moment my hown cuthen th gone to mithter wemmick at thith prethent minute to hoffer him hany termth
<s> mithter jaggerth half a quarter of a moment if you d have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t other thide at hany thuperior prithe money no object mithter jaggerth mithter
<s> my guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot
<s> without further interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap
<s> here s mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and approaching mr
<s> jaggers confidentially
<s> oh said mr
<s> jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead like the bull in cock robin pulling at the bell rope your man comes on this afternoon
<s> well
<s> well mas r jaggers returned mike in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold arter a deal o trouble i ve found one sir as might do
<s> what is he prepared to swear
<s> well mas r jaggers said mike wiping his nose on his fur cap this time in a general way anythink
<s> mr
<s> jaggers suddenly became most irate
<s> now i warned you before said he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here i d make an example of you
<s> you infernal scoundrel how dare you tell me that
<s> the client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious what he had done
<s> spooney said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his elbow
<s> soft head need you say it face to face
<s> now i ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear
<s> mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face and slowly replied ayther to character or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question
<s> now be careful
<s> in what station of life is this man
<s> mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before beginning to reply in a nervous manner we ve dressed him up like when my guardian blustered out
<s> what you will will you
<s> spooney added the clerk again with another stir
<s> after some helpless casting about mike brightened and began again
<s> he is dressed like a spectable pieman
<s> a sort of a pastry cook
<s> is he here asked my guardian
<s> i left him said mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner
<s> take him past that window and let me see him
<s> the window indicated was the office window
<s> we all three went to it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner with a murderous looking tall individual in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap
<s> this guileless confectioner was not by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery which was painted over
<s> tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that
<s> my guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched standing from a sandwich box and a pocket flask of sherry he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he had made for me
<s> i was to go to barnard s inn to young mr
<s> pocket s rooms where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation i was to remain with young mr
<s> pocket until monday on monday i was to go with him to his father s house on a visit that i might try how i liked it
<s> also i was told what my allowance was to be it was a very liberal one and had handed to me from one of my guardian s drawers the cards of certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kinds of clothes and such other things as i could in reason want
<s> you will find your credit good mr
<s> pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but i shall by this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find you outrunning the constable
<s> of course you ll go wrong somehow but that s no fault of mine
<s> after i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked mr
<s> jaggers if i could send for a coach he said it was not worth while i was so near my destination wemmick should walk round with me if i pleased
<s> i then found that wemmick was the clerk in the next room
<s> another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and i accompanied him into the street after shaking hands with my guardian
<s> we found a new set of people lingering outside but wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively i tell you it s no use he won t have a word to say to one of you and we soon got clear of them and went on side by side
<s> chapter xxi
<s> casting my eyes on mr
<s> wemmick as we went along to see what he was like in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull edged chisel
<s> there were some marks in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints
<s> the chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off
<s> i judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements for he wore at least four mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it
<s> i noticed too that several rings and seals hung at his watch chain as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends
<s> he had glittering eyes small keen and black and thin wide mottled lips
<s> he had had them to the best of my belief from forty to fifty years
<s> so you were never in london before said mr
<s> wemmick to me
<s> no said i
<s> i was new here once said mr
<s> wemmick
<s> rum to think of now
<s> you are well acquainted with it now
<s> why yes said mr
<s> wemmick
<s> i know the moves of it
<s> is it a very wicked place i asked more for the sake of saying something than for information
<s> you may get cheated robbed and murdered in london
<s> but there are plenty of people anywhere who ll do that for you
<s> if there is bad blood between you and them said i to soften it off a little
<s> o i don t know about bad blood returned mr
<s> wemmick there s not much bad blood about
<s> they ll do it if there s anything to be got by it
<s> that makes it worse
<s> you think so returned mr
<s> wemmick
<s> much about the same i should say
<s> he wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him walking in a self contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention
<s> his mouth was such a post office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling
<s> we had got to the top of holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance and that he was not smiling at all
<s> do you know where mr
<s> matthew pocket lives i asked mr
<s> wemmick
<s> yes said he nodding in the direction
<s> at hammersmith west of london
<s> is that far
<s> well say five miles
<s> do you know him
<s> why you re a regular cross examiner said mr
<s> wemmick looking at me with an approving air
<s> yes i know him
<s> i know him
<s> there was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me and i was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text when he said here we were at barnard s inn
<s> my depression was not alleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by mr
<s> barnard to which the blue boar in our town was a mere public house
<s> whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for tom cats
<s> we entered this haven through a wicket gate and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying ground
<s> i thought it had the most dismal trees in it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most dismal houses in number half a dozen or so that i had ever seen
<s> i thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled flower pot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift while to let to let to let glared at me from empty rooms as if no new wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel
<s> a frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard and it had strewn ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust hole
<s> thus far my sense of sight while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching stables near at hand besides addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned try barnard s mixture
<s> so imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great expectations that i looked in dismay at mr
<s> wemmick
<s> ah said he mistaking me the retirement reminds you of the country
<s> so it does me
<s> he led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down to a set of chambers on the top floor
<s> mr
<s> pocket jun
<s> was painted on the door and there was a label on the letter box return shortly
<s> he hardly thought you d come so soon mr
<s> wemmick explained
<s> you don t want me any more
<s> no thank you said i
<s> as i keep the cash mr
<s> wemmick observed we shall most likely meet pretty often
<s> good day
<s> good day
<s> i put out my hand and mr
<s> wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought i wanted something
<s> then he looked at me and said correcting himself
<s> to be sure yes
<s> you re in the habit of shaking hands
<s> i was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion but said yes
<s> i have got so out of it said mr
<s> wemmick except at last
<s> very glad i m sure to make your acquaintance
<s> good day
<s> when we had shaken hands and he was gone i opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it came down like the guillotine
<s> happily it was so quick that i had not put my head out
<s> after this escape i was content to take a foggy view of the inn through the window s encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully looking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated
<s> mr
<s> pocket junior s idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window before i heard footsteps on the stairs
<s> gradually there arose before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a member of society of about my own standing
<s> he had a paper bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of breath
<s> mr
<s> pip said he
<s> mr
<s> pocket said i
<s> dear me he exclaimed
<s> i am extremely sorry but i knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday and i thought you would come by that one
<s> the fact is i have been out on your account not that that is any excuse for i thought coming from the country you might like a little fruit after dinner and i went to covent garden market to get it good
<s> for a reason that i had i felt as if my eyes would start out of my head
<s> i acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think this was a dream
<s> dear me said mr
<s> pocket junior
<s> this door sticks so
<s> as he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper bags were under his arms i begged him to allow me to hold them
<s> he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast
<s> it yielded so suddenly at last that he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite door and we both laughed
<s> but still i felt as if my eyes must start out of my head and as if this must be a dream
<s> pray come in said mr
<s> pocket junior
<s> allow me to lead the way
<s> i am rather bare here but i hope you ll be able to make out tolerably well till monday
<s> my father thought you would get on more agreeably through to morrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk about london
<s> i am sure i shall be very happy to show london to you
<s> as to our table you won t find that bad i hope for it will be supplied from our coffee house here and it is only right i should add at your expense such being mr
<s> jaggers s directions
<s> as to our lodging it s not by any means splendid because i have my own bread to earn and my father hasn t anything to give me and i shouldn t be willing to take it if he had
<s> this is our sitting room just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth you see as they could spare from home
<s> you mustn t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come for you from the coffee house
<s> this is my little bedroom rather musty but barnard s is musty
<s> this is your bedroom the furniture s hired for the occasion but i trust it will answer the purpose if you should want anything i ll go and fetch it
<s> the chambers are retired and we shall be alone together but we shan t fight i dare say
<s> but dear me i beg your pardon you re holding the fruit all this time
<s> pray let me take these bags from you
<s> i am quite ashamed
<s> as i stood opposite to mr
<s> pocket junior delivering him the bags one two i saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that i knew to be in mine and he said falling back
<s> lord bless me you re the prowling boy
<s> and you said i are the pale young gentleman
<s> chapter xxii
<s> the pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in barnard s inn until we both burst out laughing
<s> the idea of its being you said he
<s> the idea of its being you said i
<s> and then we contemplated one another afresh and laughed again
<s> well said the pale young gentleman reaching out his hand good humouredly it s all over now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if you ll forgive me for having knocked you about so
<s> i derived from this speech that mr
<s> herbert pocket for herbert was the pale young gentleman s name still rather confounded his intention with his execution
<s> but i made a modest reply and we shook hands warmly
<s> you hadn t come into your good fortune at that time said herbert pocket
<s> no said i
<s> no he acquiesced i heard it had happened very lately
<s> i was rather on the lookout for good fortune then
<s> indeed
<s> yes
<s> miss havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to me
<s> but she couldn t at all events she didn t
<s> i thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that
<s> bad taste said herbert laughing but a fact
<s> yes she had sent for me on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i suppose i should have been provided for perhaps i should have been what you may called it to estella
<s> what s that i asked with sudden gravity
<s> he was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word
<s> affianced he explained still busy with the fruit
<s> betrothed
<s> engaged
<s> what s his named
<s> any word of that sort
<s> how did you bear your disappointment i asked
<s> pooh said he i didn t care much for it
<s> she s a tartar
<s> miss havisham
<s> i don t say no to that but i meant estella
<s> that girl s hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by miss havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex
<s> what relation is she to miss havisham
<s> none said he
<s> only adopted
<s> why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex what revenge
<s> lord mr
<s> pip said he
<s> don t you know
<s> no said i
<s> dear me it s quite a story and shall be saved till dinner time
<s> and now let me take the liberty of asking you a question
<s> how did you come there that day
<s> i told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst out laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards i didn t ask him if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly established
<s> mr
<s> jaggers is your guardian i understand he went on
<s> yes
<s> you know he is miss havisham s man of business and solicitor and has her confidence when nobody else has
<s> this was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground
<s> i answered with a constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen mr
<s> jaggers in miss havisham s house on the very day of our combat but never at any other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there
<s> he was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he called on my father to propose it
<s> of course he knew about my father from his connection with miss havisham
<s> my father is miss havisham s cousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her
<s> herbert pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking
<s> i had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean
<s> there was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich
<s> i don t know how this was
<s> i became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what means
<s> he was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem indicative of natural strength
<s> he had not a handsome face but it was better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful
<s> his figure was a little ungainly as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and young
<s> whether mr
<s> trabb s local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me may be a question but i am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than i carried off my new suit
<s> as he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years
<s> i therefore told him my small story and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was
<s> i further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place and knew very little of the ways of politeness i would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong
<s> with pleasure said he though i venture to prophesy that you ll want very few hints
<s> i dare say we shall be often together and i should like to banish any needless restraint between us
<s> will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbert
<s> i thanked him and said i would
<s> i informed him in exchange that my christian name was philip
<s> i don t take to philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling book who was so lazy that he fell into a pond or so fat that he couldn t see out of his eyes or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a bird s nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighbourhood
<s> i tell you what i should like
<s> we are so harmonious and you have been a blacksmith would you mind it
<s> i shouldn t mind anything that you propose i answered but i don t understand you
<s> would you mind handel for a familiar name there s a charming piece of music by handel called the harmonious blacksmith
<s> i should like it very much
<s> then my dear handel said he turning round as the door opened here is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the table because the dinner is of your providing
<s> this i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him
<s> it was a nice little dinner seemed to me then a very lord mayor s feast and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances with no old people by and with london all around us
<s> this again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off for while the table was as mr
<s> pumblechook might have said the lap of luxury being entirely furnished forth from the coffee house the circumjacent region of sitting room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he fell over them the melted butter in the arm chair the bread on the bookshelves the cheese in the coal scuttle and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room where i found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when i retired for the night
<s> all this made the feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my pleasure was without alloy
<s> we had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert of his promise to tell me about miss havisham
<s> true he replied
<s> i ll redeem it at once
<s> let me introduce the topic handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth for fear of accidents and that while the fork is reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary
<s> it is scarcely worth mentioning only it s as well to do as other people do
<s> also the spoon is not generally used over hand but under
<s> this has two advantages
<s> you get at your mouth better which after all is the object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on the part of the right elbow
<s> he offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both laughed and i scarcely blushed
<s> now he pursued concerning miss havisham
<s> miss havisham you must know was a spoilt child
<s> her mother died when she was a baby and her father denied her nothing
<s> her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world and was a brewer
<s> i don t know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was and brew
<s> you see it every day
<s> yet a gentleman may not keep a public house may he said i
<s> not on any account returned herbert but a public house may keep a gentleman
<s> well mr
<s> havisham was very rich and very proud
<s> so was his daughter
<s> miss havisham was an only child i hazarded
<s> stop a moment i am coming to that
<s> no she was not an only child she had a half brother
<s> her father privately married again his cook i rather think
<s> i thought he was proud said i
<s> my good handel so he was
<s> he married his second wife privately because he was proud and in course of time she died
<s> when she was dead i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are acquainted with
<s> as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous extravagant undutiful altogether bad
<s> at last his father disinherited him but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though not nearly so well off as miss havisham
<s> take another glass of wine and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one s glass as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one s nose
<s> i had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital
<s> i thanked him and apologised
<s> he said not at all and resumed
<s> miss havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after as a great match
<s> her half brother had now ample means again but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again
<s> there were stronger differences between him and her than there had been between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father s anger
<s> now i come to the cruel part of the story merely breaking off my dear handel to remark that a dinner napkin will not go into a tumbler
<s> why i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to say
<s> i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits
<s> again i thanked him and apologised and again he said in the cheerfullest manner not at all i am sure and resumed
<s> there appeared upon the scene say at the races or the public balls or anywhere else you like a certain man who made love to miss havisham
<s> i never saw him for this happened five and twenty years ago before you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose
<s> but that he was not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my father most strongly asseverates because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world began a true gentleman in manner
<s> he says no varnish can hide the grain of the wood and that the more varnish you put on the more the grain will express itself
<s> well this man pursued miss havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her
<s> i believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then and she passionately loved him
<s> there is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him
<s> he practised on her affection in that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all
<s> your guardian was not at that time in miss havisham s counsels and she was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one
<s> her relations were poor and scheming with the exception of my father he was poor enough but not time serving or jealous
<s> the only independent one among them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power
<s> she took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his presence and my father has never seen her since
<s> i thought of her having said matthew will come and see me at last when i am laid dead upon that table and i asked herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her
<s> it s not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would look true even to him and even to her
<s> to return to the man and make an end of him
<s> the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were invited
<s> the day came but not the bridegroom
<s> he wrote her a letter
<s> which she received i struck in when she was dressing for her marriage at twenty minutes to nine
<s> at the hour and minute said herbert nodding at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks
<s> what was in it further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off i can t tell you because i don t know
<s> when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since looked upon the light of day
<s> is that all the story i asked after considering it
<s> all i know of it and indeed i only know so much through piecing it out for myself for my father always avoids it and even when miss havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite i should understand
<s> but i have forgotten one thing
<s> it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her half brother that it was a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profits
<s> i wonder he didn t marry her and get all the property said i
<s> he may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half brother s scheme said herbert
<s> mind i don t know that
<s> what became of the two men i asked after again considering the subject
<s> they fell into deeper shame and degradation if there can be deeper and ruin
<s> are they alive now
<s> i don t know
<s> you said just now that estella was not related to miss havisham but adopted
<s> when adopted
<s> herbert shrugged his shoulders
<s> there has always been an estella since i have heard of a miss havisham
<s> i know no more
<s> and now handel said he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly open understanding between us
<s> all that i know about miss havisham you know
<s> and all that i know i retorted you know
<s> i fully believe it
<s> so there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me
<s> and as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life namely that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me
<s> in truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject done with even though i should be under his father s roof for years and years to come
<s> yet he said it with so much meaning too that i felt he as perfectly understood miss havisham to be my benefactress as i understood the fact myself
<s> it had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this to be the case
<s> we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the course of conversation what he was he replied a capitalist an insurer of ships
<s> i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added in the city
<s> i had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in the city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible head open
<s> but again there came upon me for my relief that odd impression that herbert pocket would never be very successful or rich
<s> i shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships
<s> i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut into the direction
<s> i shall also do a little in the mining way
<s> none of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account
<s> i think i shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious woods
<s> it s an interesting trade
<s> and the profits are large said i
<s> tremendous said he
<s> i wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than my own
<s> 0189m
<s> i think i shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his waist coat pockets to the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum
<s> also to ceylon especially for elephants tusks
<s> you will want a good many ships said i
<s> a perfect fleet said he
<s> quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present
<s> i haven t begun insuring yet he replied
<s> i am looking about me
<s> somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnard s inn
<s> i said in a tone of conviction ah h
<s> yes
<s> i am in a counting house and looking about me
<s> is a counting house profitable i asked
<s> to do you mean to the young fellow who s in it he asked in reply
<s> yes to you
<s> why n no not to me
<s> he said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance
<s> not directly profitable
<s> that is it doesn t pay me anything and i have to keep myself
<s> this certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as if i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income
<s> but the thing is said herbert pocket that you look about you
<s> that s the grand thing
<s> you are in a counting house you know and you look about you
<s> it struck me as a singular implication that you couldn t be out of a counting house you know and look about you but i silently deferred to his experience
<s> then the time comes said herbert when you see your opening
<s> and you go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there you are when you have once made your capital you have nothing to do but employ it
<s> this was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden very like
<s> his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat
<s> it seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then
<s> it was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee house or somewhere else
<s> yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so unassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up
<s> it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways and we got on famously
<s> in the evening we went out for a walk in the streets and went half price to the theatre and next day we went to church at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the parks and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished joe did
<s> on a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had left joe and biddy
<s> the space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion and our marshes were any distance off
<s> that i could have been at our old church in my old church going clothes on the very last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities geographical and social solar and lunar
<s> yet in the london streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of night the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about barnard s inn under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart
<s> on the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert went to the counting house to report himself to look about him too i suppose and i bore him company
<s> he was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him
<s> it appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning
<s> nor did the counting house where herbert assisted show in my eyes as at all a good observatory being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second floor rather than a look out
<s> i waited about until it was noon and i went upon change and i saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to be great merchants though i couldn t understand why they should all be out of spirits
<s> when herbert came we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help noticing even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters clothes than in the steaks
<s> this collation disposed of at a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we went back to barnard s inn and got my little portmanteau and then took coach for hammersmith
<s> we arrived there at two or three o clock in the afternoon and had very little way to walk to mr
<s> pocket s house
<s> lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river where mr
<s> pocket s children were playing about
<s> and unless i deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that mr
<s> and mrs
<s> pocket s children were not growing up or being brought up but were tumbling up
<s> mrs
<s> pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with her legs upon another garden chair and mrs
<s> pocket s two nurse maids were looking about them while the children played
<s> mamma said herbert this is young mr
<s> pip
<s> upon which mrs
<s> pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity
<s> master alick and miss jane cried one of the nurses to two of the children if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you ll fall over into the river and be drownded and what ll your pa say then
<s> at the same time this nurse picked up mrs
<s> pocket s handkerchief and said if that don t make six times you ve dropped it mum upon which mrs
<s> pocket laughed and said thank you flopson and settling herself in one chair only resumed her book
<s> her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eyes upon me and said i hope your mamma is quite well this unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person i had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue
<s> well she cried picking up the pocket handkerchief if that don t make seven times what are you a doing of this afternoon mum mrs
<s> pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of recognition and said thank you flopson and forgot me and went on reading
<s> i found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than six little pockets present in various stages of tumbling up
<s> i had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region of air wailing dolefully
<s> if there ain t baby said flopson appearing to think it most surprising
<s> make haste up millers
<s> millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees the child s wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth
<s> mrs
<s> pocket read all the time and i was curious to know what the book could be
<s> we were waiting i supposed for mr
<s> pocket to come out to us at any rate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near mrs
<s> pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her always very much to her momentary astonishment and their own more enduring lamentation
<s> i was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby which baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to mrs
<s> pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over mrs
<s> pocket baby and all and was caught by herbert and myself
<s> gracious me flopson said mrs
<s> pocket looking off her book for a moment everybody s tumbling
<s> gracious you indeed mum returned flopson very red in the face what have you got there
<s> i got here flopson asked mrs
<s> pocket
<s> why if it ain t your footstool cried flopson
<s> and if you keep it under your skirts like that who s to help tumbling here take the baby mum and give me your book
<s> mrs
<s> pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap while the other children played about it
<s> this had lasted but a very short time when mrs
<s> pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap
<s> thus i made the second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down
<s> under these circumstances when flopson and millers had got the children into the house like a little flock of sheep and mr
<s> pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to find that mr
<s> pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face and with his very grey hair disordered on his head as if he didn t quite see his way to putting anything straight
<s> chapter xxiii
<s> mr
<s> pocket said he was glad to see me and he hoped i was not sorry to see him
<s> for i really am not he added with his son s smile an alarming personage
<s> he was a young looking man in spite of his perplexities and his very grey hair and his manner seemed quite natural
<s> i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so
<s> when he had talked with me a little he said to mrs
<s> pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were black and handsome belinda i hope you have welcomed mr
<s> pip and she looked up from her book and said yes
<s> she then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of orange flower water as the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been thrown out like her previous approaches in general conversational condescension
<s> i found out within a few hours and may mention at once that mrs
<s> pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a baronet but for somebody s determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives i forget whose if i ever knew the sovereign s the prime minister s the lord chancellor s the archbishop of canterbury s anybody s and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact
<s> i believe he had been knighted himself for storming the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other and for handing some royal personage either the trowel or the mortar
<s> be that as it may he had directed mrs
<s> pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge
<s> so successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but perfectly helpless and useless
<s> with her character thus happily formed in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered mr
<s> pocket who was also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre
<s> as his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time he and mrs
<s> pocket had taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent
<s> the judicious parent having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle and had informed mr
<s> pocket that his wife was a treasure for a prince
<s> mr
<s> pocket had invested the prince s treasure in the ways of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest
<s> still mrs
<s> pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married a title while mr
<s> pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach because he had never got one
<s> mr
<s> pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a pleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for my own private sitting room
<s> he then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms and introduced me to their occupants by name drummle and startop
<s> drummle an old looking young man of a heavy order of architecture was whistling
<s> startop younger in years and appearance was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge
<s> both mr
<s> and mrs
<s> pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else s hands that i wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the servants
<s> it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs
<s> they allowed a very liberal table to mr
<s> and mrs
<s> pocket yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen always supposing the boarder capable of self defence for before i had been there a week a neighbouring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen millers slapping the baby
<s> this greatly distressed mrs
<s> pocket who burst into tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn t mind their own business
<s> by degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert that mr
<s> pocket had been educated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished himself but that when he had had the happiness of marrying mrs
<s> pocket very early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a grinder
<s> after grinding a number of dull blades of whom it was remarkable that their fathers when influential were always going to help him to preferment but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the grindstone he had wearied of that poor work and had come to london
<s> here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them and had refurbished divers others for special occasions and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction and on such means added to some very moderate private resources still maintained the house i saw
<s> mr
<s> and mrs
<s> pocket had a toady neighbour a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody and shed smiles and tears on everybody according to circumstances
<s> this lady s name was mrs
<s> coiler and i had the honour of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation
<s> she gave me to understand on the stairs that it was a blow to dear mrs
<s> pocket that dear mr
<s> pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him
<s> that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence at that time i had known her something less than five minutes if they were all like me it would be quite another thing
<s> but dear mrs
<s> pocket said mrs
<s> coiler after her early disappointment not that dear mr
<s> pocket was to blame in that requires so much luxury and elegance
<s> yes ma am i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to cry
<s> and she is of so aristocratic a disposition
<s> yes ma am i said again with the same object as before
<s> that it is hard said mrs
<s> coiler to have dear mr
<s> pocket s time and attention diverted from dear mrs
<s> pocket
<s> i could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher s time and attention were diverted from dear mrs
<s> pocket but i said nothing and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners
<s> it came to my knowledge through what passed between mrs
<s> pocket and drummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and other instruments of self destruction that drummle whose christian name was bentley was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy
<s> it further appeared that the book i had seen mrs
<s> pocket reading in the garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all
<s> drummle didn t say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognised mrs
<s> pocket as a woman and a sister
<s> no one but themselves and mrs
<s> coiler the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it appeared to me that it was painful to herbert but it promised to last a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction
<s> it was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef
<s> to my unutterable amazement i now for the first time saw mr
<s> pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and with which i soon became as familiar as the rest
<s> he laid down the carving knife and fork being engaged in carving at the moment put his two hands into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it
<s> when he had done this and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he was about
<s> mrs
<s> coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me
<s> i liked it for a few moments but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over
<s> she had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities i had left which was altogether snaky and fork tongued and when she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little to her or upon drummle who said less i rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table
<s> after dinner the children were introduced and mrs
<s> coiler made admiring comments on their eyes noses and legs a sagacious way of improving their minds
<s> there were four little girls and two little boys besides the baby who might have been either and the baby s next successor who was as yet neither
<s> they were brought in by flopson and millers much as though those two non commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these while mrs
<s> pocket looked at the young nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before but didn t quite know what to make of them
<s> here give me your fork mum and take the baby said flopson
<s> don t take it that way or you ll get its head under the table
<s> thus advised mrs
<s> pocket took it the other way and got its head upon the table which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion
<s> dear dear give it me back mum said flopson and miss jane come and dance to baby do
<s> one of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and laughed
<s> then all the children laughed and mr
<s> pocket who in the meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair laughed and we all laughed and were glad
<s> flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll then got it safely into mrs
<s> pocket s lap and gave it the nut crackers to play with at the same time recommending mrs
<s> pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes and sharply charging miss jane to look after the same
<s> then the two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming table
<s> i was made very uneasy in my mind by mrs
<s> pocket s falling into a discussion with drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the baby on her lap who did most appalling things with the nut crackers
<s> at length little jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away
<s> mrs
<s> pocket finishing her orange at about the same time and not approving of this said to jane
<s> you naughty child how dare you go and sit down this instant
<s> mamma dear lisped the little girl baby ood have put hith eyeth out
<s> how dare you tell me so retorted mrs
<s> pocket
<s> go and sit down in your chair this moment
<s> mrs
<s> pocket s dignity was so crushing that i felt quite abashed as if i myself had done something to rouse it
<s> belinda remonstrated mr
<s> pocket from the other end of the table how can you be so unreasonable jane only interfered for the protection of baby
<s> i will not allow anybody to interfere said mrs
<s> pocket
<s> i am surprised matthew that you should expose me to the affront of interference
<s> good god cried mr
<s> pocket in an outbreak of desolate desperation
<s> are infants to be nut crackered into their tombs and is nobody to save them
<s> i will not be interfered with by jane said mrs
<s> pocket with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender
<s> i hope i know my poor grandpapa s position
<s> jane indeed
<s> mr
<s> pocket got his hands in his hair again and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair
<s> hear this he helplessly exclaimed to the elements
<s> babies are to be nut crackered dead for people s poor grandpapa s positions then he let himself down again and became silent
<s> we all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on
<s> a pause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little jane who appeared to me to be the only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had any decided acquaintance
<s> mr
<s> drummle said mrs
<s> pocket will you ring for flopson jane you undutiful little thing go and lie down
<s> now baby darling come with ma
<s> the baby was the soul of honour and protested with all its might
<s> it doubled itself up the wrong way over mrs
<s> pocket s arm exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny
<s> and it gained its point after all for i saw it through the window within a few minutes being nursed by little jane
<s> it happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner table through flopson s having some private engagement and their not being anybody else s business
<s> i thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and mr
<s> pocket which were exemplified in the following manner
<s> mr
<s> pocket with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes as if he couldn t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment and why they hadn t been billeted by nature on somebody else
<s> then in a distant missionary way he asked them certain questions as why little joe had that hole in his frill who said pa flopson was going to mend it when she had time and how little fanny came by that whitlow who said pa millers was going to poultice it when she didn t forget
<s> then he melted into parental tenderness and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as they went out with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject
<s> in the evening there was rowing on the river
<s> as drummle and startop had each a boat i resolved to set up mine and to cut them both out
<s> i was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts but as i was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the thames not to say for other waters i at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize wherry who plied at our stairs and to whom i was introduced by my new allies
<s> this practical authority confused me very much by saying i had the arm of a blacksmith
<s> if he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil i doubt if he would have paid it
<s> there was a supper tray after we got home at night and i think we should all have enjoyed ourselves but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence
<s> mr
<s> pocket was in good spirits when a housemaid came in and said if you please sir i should wish to speak to you
<s> speak to your master said mrs
<s> pocket whose dignity was roused again
<s> how can you think of such a thing go and speak to flopson
<s> or speak to me at some other time
<s> begging your pardon ma am returned the housemaid i should wish to speak at once and to speak to master
<s> hereupon mr
<s> pocket went out of the room and we made the best of ourselves until he came back
<s> this is a pretty thing belinda said mr
<s> pocket returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair
<s> here s the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease
<s> mrs
<s> pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion and said this is that odious sophia s doing
<s> what do you mean belinda demanded mr
<s> pocket
<s> sophia has told you said mrs
<s> pocket
<s> did i not see her with my own eyes and hear her with my own ears come into the room just now and ask to speak to you
<s> but has she not taken me downstairs belinda returned mr
<s> pocket and shown me the woman and the bundle too
<s> and do you defend her matthew said mrs
<s> pocket for making mischief
<s> mr
<s> pocket uttered a dismal groan
<s> am i grandpapa s granddaughter to be nothing in the house said mrs
<s> pocket
<s> besides the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation that she felt i was born to be a duchess
<s> there was a sofa where mr
<s> pocket stood and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the dying gladiator
<s> still in that attitude he said with a hollow voice good night mr
<s> pip when i deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him
<s> chapter xxiv
<s> after two or three days when i had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to london several times and had ordered all i wanted of my tradesmen mr
<s> pocket and i had a long talk together
<s> he knew more of my intended career than i knew myself for he referred to his having been told by mr
<s> jaggers that i was not designed for any profession and that i should be well enough educated for my destiny if i could hold my own with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances
<s> i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary
<s> he advised my attending certain places in london for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as i wanted and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies
<s> he hoped that with intelligent assistance i should meet with little to discourage me and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his
<s> through his way of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and i may state at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his compact with me that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling mine with him
<s> if he had shown indifference as a master i have no doubt i should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no such excuse and each of us did the other justice
<s> nor did i ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him or anything but what was serious honest and good in his tutor communication with me
<s> when these points were settled and so far carried out as that i had begun to work in earnest it occurred to me that if i could retain my bedroom in barnard s inn my life would be agreeably varied while my manners would be none the worse for herbert s society
<s> mr
<s> pocket did not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it it must be submitted to my guardian
<s> i felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save herbert some expense so i went off to little britain and imparted my wish to mr
<s> jaggers
<s> if i could buy the furniture now hired for me said i and one or two other little things i should be quite at home there
<s> go it said mr
<s> jaggers with a short laugh
<s> i told you you d get on
<s> well how much do you want
<s> i said i didn t know how much
<s> come retorted mr
<s> jaggers
<s> how much fifty pounds
<s> o not nearly so much
<s> five pounds said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> this was such a great fall that i said in discomfiture o more than that
<s> more than that eh retorted mr
<s> jaggers lying in wait for me with his hands in his pockets his head on one side and his eyes on the wall behind me how much more
<s> it is so difficult to fix a sum said i hesitating
<s> come said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> let s get at it
<s> twice five will that do three times five will that do four times five will that do
<s> i said i thought that would do handsomely
<s> four times five will do handsomely will it said mr
<s> jaggers knitting his brows
<s> now what do you make of four times five
<s> what do i make of it
<s> ah said mr
<s> jaggers how much
<s> i suppose you make it twenty pounds said i smiling
<s> never mind what i make it my friend observed mr
<s> jaggers with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head
<s> i want to know what you make it
<s> twenty pounds of course
<s> wemmick said mr
<s> jaggers opening his office door
<s> take mr
<s> pip s written order and pay him twenty pounds
<s> this strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me and that not of an agreeable kind
<s> mr
<s> jaggers never laughed but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising himself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to creak as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way
<s> as he happened to go out now and as wemmick was brisk and talkative i said to wemmick that i hardly knew what to make of mr
<s> jaggers s manner
<s> tell him that and he ll take it as a compliment answered wemmick he don t mean that you should know what to make of it
<s> oh for i looked surprised it s not personal it s professional only professional
<s> wemmick was at his desk lunching and crunching on a dry hard biscuit pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as if he were posting them
<s> always seems to me said wemmick as if he had set a man trap and was watching it
<s> suddenly click you re caught
<s> without remarking that man traps were not among the amenities of life i said i supposed he was very skilful
<s> deep said wemmick as australia
<s> pointing with his pen at the office floor to express that australia was understood for the purposes of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe
<s> if there was anything deeper added wemmick bringing his pen to paper he d be it
<s> then i said i supposed he had a fine business and wemmick said ca pi tal then i asked if there were many clerks to which he replied
<s> we don t run much into clerks because there s only one jaggers and people won t have him at second hand
<s> there are only four of us
<s> would you like to see em you are one of us as i may say
<s> i accepted the offer
<s> when mr
<s> wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post and had paid me my money from a cash box in a safe the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat collar like an iron pigtail we went upstairs
<s> the house was dark and shabby and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in mr
<s> jaggers s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years
<s> in the front first floor a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat catcher a large pale puffed swollen man was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to mr
<s> jaggers s coffers
<s> getting evidence together said mr
<s> wemmick as we came out for the bailey
<s> in the room over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes whom mr
<s> wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt me anything i pleased and who was in an excessive white perspiration as if he had been trying his art on himself
<s> in a back room a high shouldered man with a face ache tied up in dirty flannel who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen for mr
<s> jaggers s own use
<s> this was all the establishment
<s> when we went downstairs again wemmick led me into my guardian s room and said this you ve seen already
<s> pray said i as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again whose likenesses are those
<s> these said wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down
<s> these are two celebrated ones
<s> famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit
<s> this chap why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand to get this blot upon your eyebrow you old rascal murdered his master and considering that he wasn t brought up to evidence didn t plan it badly
<s> is it like him i asked recoiling from the brute as wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve
<s> like him it s himself you know
<s> the cast was made in newgate directly after he was taken down
<s> you had a particular fancy for me hadn t you old artful said wemmick
<s> he then explained this affectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying had it made for me express
<s> is the lady anybody said i
<s> no returned wemmick
<s> only his game
<s> you liked your bit of game didn t you no deuce a bit of a lady in the case mr
<s> pip except one and she wasn t of this slender lady like sort and you wouldn t have caught her looking after this urn unless there was something to drink in it
<s> wemmick s attention being thus directed to his brooch he put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pocket handkerchief
<s> did that other creature come to the same end i asked
<s> he has the same look
<s> you re right said wemmick it s the genuine look
<s> much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse hair and a little fish hook
<s> yes he came to the same end quite the natural end here i assure you
<s> he forged wills this blade did if he didn t also put the supposed testators to sleep too
<s> you were a gentlemanly cove though mr
<s> wemmick was again apostrophising and you said you could write greek
<s> yah bounceable what a liar you were i never met such a liar as you before putting his late friend on his shelf again wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said sent out to buy it for me only the day before
<s> while he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources
<s> as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before me dusting his hands
<s> o yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind
<s> one brings another you see that s the way of it
<s> i always take em
<s> they re curiosities
<s> and they re property
<s> they may not be worth much but after all they re property and portable
<s> it don t signify to you with your brilliant lookout but as to myself my guiding star always is get hold of portable property
<s> when i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a friendly manner
<s> if at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldn t mind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i should consider it an honour
<s> i have not much to show you but such two or three curiosities as i have got you might like to look over and i am fond of a bit of garden and a summer house
<s> i said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality
<s> thankee said he then we ll consider that it s to come off when convenient to you
<s> have you dined with mr
<s> jaggers yet
<s> not yet
<s> well said wemmick he ll give you wine and good wine
<s> i ll give you punch and not bad punch
<s> and now i ll tell you something
<s> when you go to dine with mr
<s> jaggers look at his housekeeper
<s> shall i see something very uncommon
<s> well said wemmick you ll see a wild beast tamed
<s> not so very uncommon you ll tell me
<s> i reply that depends on the original wildness of the beast and the amount of taming
<s> it won t lower your opinion of mr
<s> jaggers s powers
<s> keep your eye on it
<s> i told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened
<s> as i was taking my departure he asked me if i would like to devote five minutes to seeing mr
<s> jaggers at it
<s> for several reasons and not least because i didn t clearly know what mr
<s> jaggers would be found to be at i replied in the affirmative
<s> we dived into the city and came up in a crowded police court where a blood relation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches was standing at the bar uncomfortably chewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross examination i don t know which and was striking her and the bench and everybody present with awe
<s> if anybody of whatsoever degree said a word that he didn t approve of he instantly required to have it taken down
<s> if anybody wouldn t make an admission he said i ll have it out of you and if anybody made an admission he said now i have got you the magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger
<s> thieves and thief takers hung in dread rapture on his words and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction
<s> which side he was on i couldn t make out for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill i only know that when i stole out on tiptoe he was not on the side of the bench for he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided quite convulsive under the table by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of british law and justice in that chair that day
<s> chapter xxv
<s> bentley drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit
<s> heavy in figure movement and comprehension in the sluggish complexion of his face and in the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room he was idle proud niggardly reserved and suspicious
<s> he came of rich people down in somersetshire who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead
<s> thus bentley drummle had come to mr
<s> pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen
<s> startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and admired her beyond measure
<s> he had a woman s delicacy of feature and was as you may see though you never saw her said herbert to me exactly like his mother
<s> it was but natural that i should take to him much more kindly than to drummle and that even in the earliest evenings of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one another conversing from boat to boat while bentley drummle came up in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes
<s> he would always creep in shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and i always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back water when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid stream
<s> herbert was my intimate companion and friend
<s> i presented him with a half share in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down to hammersmith and my possession of a half share in his chambers often took me up to london
<s> we used to walk between the two places at all hours
<s> i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope
<s> when i had been in mr
<s> pocket s family a month or two mr
<s> and mrs
<s> camilla turned up
<s> camilla was mr
<s> pocket s sister
<s> georgiana whom i had seen at miss havisham s on the same occasion also turned up
<s> she was a cousin an indigestive single woman who called her rigidity religion and her liver love
<s> these people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment
<s> as a matter of course they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness
<s> towards mr
<s> pocket as a grown up infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the complacent forbearance i had heard them express
<s> mrs
<s> pocket they held in contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves
<s> these were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied myself to my education
<s> i soon contracted expensive habits and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should have thought almost fabulous but through good and evil i stuck to my books
<s> there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies
<s> between mr
<s> pocket and herbert i got on fast and with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i wanted and clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as great a dolt as drummle if i had done less
<s> i had not seen mr
<s> wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening
<s> he replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect me at the office at six o clock
<s> thither i went and there i found him putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck
<s> did you think of walking down to walworth said he
<s> certainly said i if you approve
<s> very much was wemmick s reply for i have had my legs under the desk all day and shall be glad to stretch them
<s> now i ll tell you what i have got for supper mr
<s> pip
<s> i have got a stewed steak which is of home preparation and a cold roast fowl which is from the cook s shop
<s> i think it s tender because the master of the shop was a juryman in some cases of ours the other day and we let him down easy
<s> i reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said pick us out a good one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two we could easily have done it
<s> he said to that let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop
<s> i let him of course
<s> as far as it goes it s property and portable
<s> you don t object to an aged parent i hope
<s> i really thought he was still speaking of the fowl until he added because i have got an aged parent at my place
<s> i then said what politeness required
<s> so you haven t dined with mr
<s> jaggers yet he pursued as we walked along
<s> not yet
<s> he told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming
<s> i expect you ll have an invitation to morrow
<s> he s going to ask your pals too
<s> three of em ain t there
<s> although i was not in the habit of counting drummle as one of my intimate associates i answered yes
<s> well he s going to ask the whole gang i hardly felt complimented by the word and whatever he gives you he ll give you good
<s> don t look forward to variety but you ll have excellence
<s> and there s another rum thing in his house proceeded wemmick after a moment s pause as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood he never lets a door or window be fastened at night
<s> is he never robbed
<s> that s it returned wemmick
<s> he says and gives it out publicly i want to see the man who ll rob me
<s> lord bless you i have heard him a hundred times if i have heard him once say to regular cracksmen in our front office you know where i live now no bolt is ever drawn there why don t you do a stroke of business with me come can t i tempt you not a man of them sir would be bold enough to try it on for love or money
<s> they dread him so much said i
<s> dread him said wemmick
<s> i believe you they dread him
<s> not but what he s artful even in his defiance of them
<s> no silver sir
<s> britannia metal every spoon
<s> so they wouldn t have much i observed even if they
<s> ah but he would have much said wemmick cutting me short and they know it
<s> he d have their lives and the lives of scores of em
<s> he d have all he could get
<s> and it s impossible to say what he couldn t get if he gave his mind to it
<s> i was falling into meditation on my guardian s greatness when wemmick remarked
<s> as to the absence of plate that s only his natural depth you know
<s> a river s its natural depth and he s his natural depth
<s> look at his watch chain
<s> that s real enough
<s> it s very massive said i
<s> massive repeated wemmick
<s> i think so
<s> and his watch is a gold repeater and worth a hundred pound if it s worth a penny
<s> mr
<s> pip there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch there s not a man a woman or a child among them who wouldn t identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it was red hot if inveigled into touching it
<s> at first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature did mr
<s> wemmick and i beguile the time and the road until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of walworth
<s> it appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement
<s> wemmick s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns
<s> my own doing said wemmick
<s> looks pretty don t it
<s> i highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw with the queerest gothic windows by far the greater part of them sham and a gothic door almost too small to get in at
<s> that s a real flagstaff you see said wemmick and on sundays i run up a real flag
<s> then look here
<s> after i have crossed this bridge i hoist it up so and cut off the communication
<s> the bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep
<s> but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so with a relish and not merely mechanically
<s> at nine o clock every night greenwich time said wemmick the gun fires
<s> there he is you see and when you hear him go i think you ll say he s a stinger
<s> the piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress constructed of lattice work
<s> it was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella
<s> then at the back said wemmick out of sight so as not to impede the idea of fortifications for it s a principle with me if you have an idea carry it out and keep it up i don t know whether that s your opinion
<s> i said decidedly
<s> at the back there s a pig and there are fowls and rabbits then i knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers and you ll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise
<s> so sir said wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions
<s> then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth
<s> our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower was raised
<s> this piece of water with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet
<s> i am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and my own gardener and my own jack of all trades said wemmick in acknowledging my compliments
<s> well it s a good thing you know
<s> it brushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged
<s> you wouldn t mind being at once introduced to the aged would you it wouldn t put you out
<s> i expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle
<s> there we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat clean cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf
<s> well aged parent said wemmick shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way how am you
<s> all right john all right replied the old man
<s> here s mr
<s> pip aged parent said wemmick and i wish you could hear his name
<s> nod away at him mr
<s> pip that s what he likes
<s> nod away at him if you please like winking
<s> this is a fine place of my son s sir cried the old man while i nodded as hard as i possibly could
<s> this is a pretty pleasure ground sir
<s> this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the nation after my son s time for the people s enjoyment
<s> you re as proud of it as punch ain t you aged said wemmick contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened there s a nod for you giving him a tremendous one there s another for you giving him a still more tremendous one you like that don t you if you re not tired mr
<s> pip though i know it s tiring to strangers will you tip him one more you can t think how it pleases him
<s> i tipped him several more and he was in great spirits
<s> we left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in the arbour where wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection
<s> is it your own mr
<s> wemmick
<s> o yes said wemmick i have got hold of it a bit at a time
<s> it s a freehold by george
<s> is it indeed i hope mr
<s> jaggers admires it
<s> never seen it said wemmick
<s> never heard of it
<s> never seen the aged
<s> never heard of him
<s> no the office is one thing and private life is another
<s> when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and when i come into the castle i leave the office behind me
<s> if it s not in any way disagreeable to you you ll oblige me by doing the same
<s> i don t wish it professionally spoken about
<s> of course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request
<s> the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and talking until it was almost nine o clock
<s> getting near gun fire said wemmick then as he laid down his pipe it s the aged s treat
<s> proceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker with expectant eyes as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony
<s> wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red hot poker from the aged and repair to the battery
<s> he took it and went out and presently the stinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in it ring
<s> upon this the aged who i believe would have been blown out of his arm chair but for holding on by the elbows cried out exultingly he s fired i heerd him and i nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him
<s> the interval between that time and supper wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities
<s> they were mostly of a felonious character comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation upon which mr
<s> wemmick set particular value as being to use his own words every one of em lies sir
<s> these were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum and some tobacco stoppers carved by the aged
<s> they were all displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had been first inducted and which served not only as the general sitting room but as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan on the hob and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting jack
<s> there was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged in the day
<s> when she had laid the supper cloth the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night
<s> the supper was excellent and though the castle was rather subject to dry rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment
<s> nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when i lay down on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that pole on my forehead all night
<s> wemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him cleaning my boots
<s> after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in a most devoted manner
<s> our breakfast was as good as the supper and at half past eight precisely we started for little britain
<s> by degrees wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened into a post office again
<s> at last when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat collar he looked as unconscious of his walworth property as if the castle and the drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the aged had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the stinger
<s> chapter xxvi
<s> it fell out as wemmick had told me it would that i had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian s establishment with that of his cashier and clerk
<s> my guardian was in his room washing his hands with his scented soap when i went into the office from walworth and he called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which wemmick had prepared me to receive
<s> no ceremony he stipulated and no dinner dress and say to morrow
<s> i asked him where we should come to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied come here and i ll take you home with me
<s> i embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or a dentist
<s> he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer s shop
<s> it had an unusually large jack towel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his hands and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room
<s> when i and my friends repaired to him at six o clock next day he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hands but laving his face and gargling his throat
<s> and even when he had done all that and had gone all round the jack towel he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on
<s> there were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence that they gave it up for that day
<s> as we walked along westward he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but he never otherwise recognised anybody or took notice that anybody recognised him
<s> he conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side of that street
<s> rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want of painting and with dirty windows
<s> he took out his key and opened the door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used
<s> so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor
<s> there were carved garlands on the panelled walls and as he stood among them giving us welcome i know what kind of loops i thought they looked like
<s> dinner was laid in the best of these rooms the second was his dressing room the third his bedroom
<s> he told us that he held the whole house but rarely used more of it than we saw
<s> the table was comfortably laid no silver in the service of course and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb waiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on it and four dishes of fruit for dessert
<s> i noticed throughout that he kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself
<s> there was a bookcase in the room i saw from the backs of the books that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials acts of parliament and such things
<s> the furniture was all very solid and good like his watch chain
<s> it had an official look however and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen
<s> in a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work
<s> as he had scarcely seen my three companions until now for he and i had walked together he stood on the hearth rug after ringing the bell and took a searching look at them
<s> to my surprise he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in drummle
<s> pip said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window i don t know one from the other
<s> who s the spider
<s> the spider said i
<s> the blotchy sprawly sulky fellow
<s> that s bentley drummle i replied the one with the delicate face is startop
<s> not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he returned bentley drummle is his name is it i like the look of that fellow
<s> he immediately began to talk to drummle not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him
<s> i was looking at the two when there came between me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table
<s> she was a woman of about forty i supposed but i may have thought her younger than she was
<s> rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely pale with large faded eyes and a quantity of streaming hair
<s> i cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter but i know that i had been to see macbeth at the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air like the faces i had seen rise out of the witches caldron
<s> she set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished
<s> we took our seats at the round table and my guardian kept drummle on one side of him while startop sat on the other
<s> it was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird
<s> sauces wines all the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our host from his dumb waiter and when they had made the circuit of the table he always put them back again
<s> similarly he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair
<s> no other attendant than the housekeeper appeared
<s> she set on every dish and i always saw in her face a face rising out of the caldron
<s> years afterwards i made a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room
<s> induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her own striking appearance and by wemmick s preparation i observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say
<s> i fancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a purpose of always holding her in suspense
<s> dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us
<s> for myself i found that i was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronise herbert and to boast of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my lips
<s> it was so with all of us but with no one more than drummle the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off
<s> it was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his
<s> drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff
<s> by some invisible agency my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner
<s> now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in drummle that to me was quite inexplicable
<s> suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper s like a trap as she stretched it across the table
<s> so suddenly and smartly did he do this that we all stopped in our foolish contention
<s> if you talk of strength said mr
<s> jaggers i ll show you a wrist
<s> molly let them see your wrist
<s> her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other hand behind her waist
<s> master she said in a low voice with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him
<s> don t
<s> i ll show you a wrist repeated mr
<s> jaggers with an immovable determination to show it
<s> molly let them see your wrist
<s> master she again murmured
<s> please
<s> molly said mr
<s> jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room let them see both your wrists
<s> show them
<s> come
<s> he took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table
<s> she brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by side
<s> the last wrist was much disfigured deeply scarred and scarred across and across
<s> when she held her hands out she took her eyes from mr
<s> jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession
<s> there s power here said mr
<s> jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger
<s> very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has
<s> it s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands
<s> i have had occasion to notice many hands but i never saw stronger in that respect man s or woman s than these
<s> while he said these words in a leisurely critical style she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat
<s> the moment he ceased she looked at him again
<s> that ll do molly said mr
<s> jaggers giving her a slight nod you have been admired and can go
<s> she withdrew her hands and went out of the room and mr
<s> jaggers putting the decanters on from his dumb waiter filled his glass and passed round the wine
<s> at half past nine gentlemen said he we must break up
<s> pray make the best use of your time
<s> i am glad to see you all
<s> mr
<s> drummle i drink to you
<s> if his object in singling out drummle were to bring him out still more it perfectly succeeded
<s> in a sulky triumph drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable
<s> through all his stages mr
<s> jaggers followed him with the same strange interest
<s> he actually seemed to serve as a zest to mr
<s> jaggers s wine
<s> in our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink and i know we talked too much
<s> we became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of drummle s to the effect that we were too free with our money
<s> it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before
<s> well retorted drummle he ll be paid
<s> i don t mean to imply that he won t said i but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money i should think
<s> you should think retorted drummle
<s> oh lord
<s> i dare say i went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldn t lend money to any of us if we wanted it
<s> you are right said drummle
<s> i wouldn t lend one of you a sixpence
<s> i wouldn t lend anybody a sixpence
<s> rather mean to borrow under those circumstances i should say
<s> you should say repeated drummle
<s> oh lord
<s> this was so very aggravating the more especially as i found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness that i said disregarding herbert s efforts to check me
<s> come mr
<s> drummle since we are on the subject i ll tell you what passed between herbert here and me when you borrowed that money
<s> i don t want to know what passed between herbert there and you growled drummle
<s> and i think he added in a lower growl that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves
<s> i ll tell you however said i whether you want to know or not
<s> we said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it
<s> drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our faces with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised plainly signifying that it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all
<s> hereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than i had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable
<s> startop being a lively bright young fellow and drummle being the exact opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront
<s> he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh
<s> resenting this little success more than anything drummle without any threat or warning pulled his hands out of his pockets dropped his round shoulders swore took up a large glass and would have flung it at his adversary s head but for our entertainer s dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose
<s> gentlemen said mr
<s> jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain i am exceedingly sorry to announce that it s half past nine
<s> on this hint we all rose to depart
<s> before we got to the street door startop was cheerily calling drummle old boy as if nothing had happened
<s> but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not even walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way so herbert and i who remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite sides startop leading and drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses much as he was wont to follow in his boat
<s> as the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert there for a moment and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian
<s> i found him in his dressing room surrounded by his stock of boots already hard at it washing his hands of us
<s> i told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything disagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame me much
<s> pooh said he sluicing his face and speaking through the water drops it s nothing pip
<s> i like that spider though
<s> he had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing and towelling himself
<s> i am glad you like him sir said i but i don t
<s> no no my guardian assented don t have too much to do with him
<s> keep as clear of him as you can
<s> but i like the fellow pip he is one of the true sort
<s> why if i was a fortune teller
<s> looking out of the towel he caught my eye
<s> but i am not a fortune teller he said letting his head drop into a festoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears
<s> you know what i am don t you good night pip
<s> good night sir
<s> in about a month after that the spider s time with mr
<s> pocket was up for good and to the great relief of all the house but mrs
<s> pocket he went home to the family hole
<s> chapter xxvii
<s> my dear mr pip
<s> i write this by request of mr
<s> gargery for to let you know that he is going to london in company with mr
<s> wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you
<s> he would call at barnard s hotel tuesday morning at nine o clock when if not agreeable please leave word
<s> your poor sister is much the same as when you left
<s> we talk of you in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing
<s> if now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of poor old days
<s> no more dear mr
<s> pip from
<s> your ever obliged and affectionate servant
<s> biddy
<s> p
<s> s
<s> he wishes me most particular to write what larks
<s> he says you will understand
<s> i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a worthy worthy man
<s> i have read him all excepting only the last little sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks
<s> i received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its appointment was for next day
<s> let me confess exactly with what feelings i looked forward to joe s coming
<s> not with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties no with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of incongruity
<s> if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly would have paid money
<s> my greatest reassurance was that he was coming to barnard s inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall in bentley drummle s way
<s> i had little objection to his being seen by herbert or his father for both of whom i had a respect but i had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by drummle whom i held in contempt
<s> so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise
<s> i had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those wrestles with barnard proved to be
<s> by this time the rooms were vastly different from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honour of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring upholsterer
<s> i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a boy in boots top boots in bondage and slavery to whom i might have been said to pass my days
<s> for after i had made the monster out of the refuse of my washerwoman s family and had clothed him with a blue coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots already mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence
<s> this avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday morning in the hall it was two feet square as charged for floorcloth and herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought joe would like
<s> while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate i had an odd half provoked sense of suspicion upon me that if joe had been coming to see him he wouldn t have been quite so brisk about it
<s> however i came into town on the monday night to be ready for joe and i got up early in the morning and caused the sitting room and breakfast table to assume their most splendid appearance
<s> unfortunately the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact that barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak giant of a sweep
<s> as the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard joe on the staircase
<s> i knew it was joe by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs his state boots being always too big for him and by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent
<s> when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole
<s> finally he gave a faint single rap and pepper such was the compromising name of the avenging boy announced mr
<s> gargery i thought he never would have done wiping his feet and that i must have gone out to lift him off the mat but at last he came in
<s> joe how are you joe
<s> pip how air you pip
<s> with his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put down on the floor between us he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down as if i had been the last patented pump
<s> i am glad to see you joe
<s> give me your hat
<s> but joe taking it up carefully with both hands like a bird s nest with eggs in it wouldn t hear of parting with that piece of property and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way
<s> which you have that growed said joe and that swelled and that gentle folked joe considered a little before he discovered this word as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country
<s> and you joe look wonderfully well
<s> thank god said joe i m ekerval to most
<s> and your sister she s no worse than she were
<s> and biddy she s ever right and ready
<s> and all friends is no backerder if not no forarder
<s> ceptin wopsle he s had a drop
<s> all this time still with both hands taking great care of the bird s nest joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing gown
<s> had a drop joe
<s> why yes said joe lowering his voice he s left the church and went into the playacting
<s> which the playacting have likeways brought him to london along with me
<s> and his wish were said joe getting the bird s nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right if no offence as i would and you that
<s> i took what joe gave me and found it to be the crumpled play bill of a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that very week of the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles
<s> were you at his performance joe i inquired
<s> i were said joe with emphasis and solemnity
<s> was there a great sensation
<s> why said joe yes there certainly were a peck of orange peel
<s> partickler when he see the ghost
<s> though i put it to yourself sir whether it were calc lated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with amen a man may have had a misfortun and been in the church said joe lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time
<s> which i meantersay if the ghost of a man s own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention what can sir still more when his mourning at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off try to keep it on how you may
<s> a ghost seeing effect in joe s own countenance informed me that herbert had entered the room
<s> so i presented joe to herbert who held out his hand but joe backed from it and held on by the bird s nest
<s> your servant sir said joe which i hope as you and pip here his eye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family that i frowned it down and confused him more i meantersay you two gentlemen which i hope as you get your elths in this close spot for the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinions said joe confidentially and i believe its character do stand it but i wouldn t keep a pig in it myself not in the case that i wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him
<s> having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling place and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me sir joe being invited to sit down to table looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney piece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals
<s> do you take tea or coffee mr
<s> gargery asked herbert who always presided of a morning
<s> thankee sir said joe stiff from head to foot i ll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself
<s> what do you say to coffee
<s> thankee sir returned joe evidently dispirited by the proposal since you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run contrairy to your own opinions
<s> but don t you never find it a little eating
<s> say tea then said herbert pouring it out
<s> here joe s hat tumbled off the mantel piece and he started out of his chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot
<s> as if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon
<s> when did you come to town mr
<s> gargery
<s> were it yesterday afternoon said joe after coughing behind his hand as if he had had time to catch the whooping cough since he came
<s> no it were not
<s> yes it were
<s> yes
<s> it were yesterday afternoon with an appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality
<s> have you seen anything of london yet
<s> why yes sir said joe me and wopsle went off straight to look at the blacking ware us
<s> but we didn t find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors which i meantersay added joe in an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral
<s> i really believe joe would have prolonged this word mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect chorus but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which was toppling
<s> indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicket keeping
<s> he made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill now rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped now merely stopping it midway beating it up and humouring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall before he felt it safe to close with it finally splashing it into the slop basin where i took the liberty of laying hands upon it
<s> 0223m
<s> as to his shirt collar and his coat collar they were perplexing to reflect upon insoluble mysteries both
<s> why should a man scrape himself to that extent before he could consider himself full dressed why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth had his eyes attracted in such strange directions was afflicted with such remarkable coughs sat so far from the table and dropped so much more than he ate and pretended that he hadn t dropped it that i was heartily glad when herbert left us for the city
<s> i had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault and that if i had been easier with joe joe would have been easier with me
<s> i felt impatient of him and out of temper with him in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head
<s> us two being now alone sir began joe
<s> joe i interrupted pettishly how can you call me sir
<s> joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach
<s> utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars were i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look
<s> us two being now alone resumed joe and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now conclude leastways begin to mention what have led to my having had the present honour
<s> for was it not said joe with his old air of lucid exposition that my only wish were to be useful to you i should not have had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen
<s> i was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance against this tone
<s> well sir pursued joe this is how it were
<s> i were at the bargemen t other night pip whenever he subsided into affection he called me pip and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir when there come up in his shay cart pumblechook
<s> which that same identical said joe going down a new track do comb my air the wrong way sometimes awful by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself
<s> nonsense
<s> it was you joe
<s> which i fully believed it were pip said joe slightly tossing his head though it signify little now sir
<s> well pip this same identical which his manners is given to blusterous come to me at the bargemen wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman sir and do not over stimilate and his word were joseph miss havisham she wish to speak to you
<s> miss havisham joe
<s> she wish were pumblechook s word to speak to you
<s> joe sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling
<s> yes joe go on please
<s> next day sir said joe looking at me as if i were a long way off having cleaned myself i go and i see miss a
<s> miss a
<s> joe miss havisham
<s> which i say sir replied joe with an air of legal formality as if he were making his will miss a
<s> or otherways havisham
<s> her expression air then as follering mr
<s> gargery
<s> you air in correspondence with mr
<s> pip having had a letter from you i were able to say i am
<s> when i married your sister sir i said i will and when i answered your friend pip i said i am
<s> would you tell him then said she that which estella has come home and would be glad to see him
<s> i felt my face fire up as i looked at joe
<s> i hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if i had known his errand i should have given him more encouragement
<s> biddy pursued joe when i got home and asked her fur to write the message to you a little hung back
<s> biddy says i know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth it is holiday time you want to see him go i have now concluded sir said joe rising from his chair and pip i wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height
<s> but you are not going now joe
<s> yes i am said joe
<s> but you are coming back to dinner joe
<s> no i am not said joe
<s> our eyes met and all the sir melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand
<s> pip dear old chap life is made of ever so many partings welded together as i may say and one man s a blacksmith and one s a whitesmith and one s a goldsmith and one s a coppersmith
<s> diwisions among such must come and must be met as they come
<s> if there s been any fault at all to day it s mine
<s> you and me is not two figures to be together in london nor yet anywheres else but what is private and beknown and understood among friends
<s> it ain t that i am proud but that i want to be right as you shall never see me no more in these clothes
<s> i m wrong in these clothes
<s> i m wrong out of the forge the kitchen or off th meshes
<s> you won t find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress with my hammer in my hand or even my pipe
<s> you won t find half so much fault in me if supposing as you should ever wish to see me you come and put your head in at the forge window and see joe the blacksmith there at the old anvil in the old burnt apron sticking to the old work
<s> i m awful dull but i hope i ve beat out something nigh the rights of this at last
<s> and so god bless you dear old pip old chap god bless you
<s> i had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him
<s> the fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words than it could come in its way in heaven
<s> he touched me gently on the forehead and went out
<s> as soon as i could recover myself sufficiently i hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighbouring streets but he was gone
<s> chapter xxviii
<s> it was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first flow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at joe s
<s> but when i had secured my box place by to morrow s coach and had been down to mr
<s> pocket s and back i was not by any means convinced on the last point and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the blue boar
<s> i should be an inconvenience at joe s i was not expected and my bed would not be ready i should be too far from miss havisham s and she was exacting and mightn t like it
<s> all other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self swindlers and with such pretences did i cheat myself
<s> surely a curious thing
<s> that i should innocently take a bad half crown of somebody else s manufacture is reasonable enough but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money an obliging stranger under pretence of compactly folding up my bank notes for security s sake abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells but what is his sleight of hand to mine when i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes
<s> having settled that i must go to the blue boar my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger
<s> it was tempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the blue boar s posting yard it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor s shop and confounding the disrespectful senses of trabb s boy
<s> on the other hand trabb s boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things or reckless and desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high street
<s> my patroness too might hear of him and not approve
<s> on the whole i resolved to leave the avenger behind
<s> it was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark
<s> our time of starting from the cross keys was two o clock
<s> i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare attended by the avenger if i may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it
<s> at that time it was customary to carry convicts down to the dock yards by stage coach
<s> as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised when herbert meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me
<s> but i had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word convict
<s> you don t mind them handel said herbert
<s> o no
<s> i thought you seemed as if you didn t like them
<s> i can t pretend that i do like them and i suppose you don t particularly
<s> but i don t mind them
<s> see there they are said herbert coming out of the tap
<s> what a degraded and vile sight it is
<s> they had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands
<s> the two convicts were handcuffed together and had irons on their legs irons of a pattern that i knew well
<s> they wore the dress that i likewise knew well
<s> their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried a thick knobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at the putting to of the horses rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the curator
<s> one was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared as a matter of course according to the mysterious ways of the world both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes
<s> his arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes and his attire disguised him absurdly but i knew his half closed eye at one glance
<s> there stood the man whom i had seen on the settle at the three jolly bargemen on a saturday night and who had brought me down with his invisible gun
<s> it was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life
<s> he looked across at me and his eye appraised my watch chain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle and looked at something else
<s> the great numbers on their backs as if they were street doors their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals their ironed legs apologetically garlanded with pocket handkerchiefs and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them made them as herbert had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle
<s> but this was not the worst of it
<s> it came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman
<s> hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful and i don t know what else
<s> at this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and the prisoners had come over with their keeper bringing with them that curious flavour of bread poultice baize rope yarn and hearthstone which attends the convict presence
<s> don t take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger i ll sit next you myself
<s> i ll put em on the outside of the row
<s> they won t interfere with you sir
<s> you needn t know they re there
<s> and don t blame me growled the convict i had recognised
<s> i don t want to go
<s> i am quite ready to stay behind
<s> as fur as i am concerned any one s welcome to my place
<s> or mine said the other gruffly
<s> i wouldn t have incommoded none of you if i d had my way
<s> then they both laughed and began cracking nuts and spitting the shells about
<s> as i really think i should have liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so despised
<s> at length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind
<s> so he got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the place next him and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could and the convict i had recognised sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head
<s> good bye handel herbert called out as we started
<s> i thought what a blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than pip
<s> it is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convict s breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine
<s> the sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid it set my very teeth on edge
<s> he seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in doing it and i was conscious of growing high shouldered on one side in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off
<s> the weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold
<s> it made us all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the half way house behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent
<s> i dozed off myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him and how it could best be done
<s> in the act of dipping forward as if i were going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the question up again
<s> but i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although i could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us
<s> cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind the convicts were closer to me than before
<s> the very first words i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the words of my own thought two one pound notes
<s> how did he get em said the convict i had never seen
<s> how should i know returned the other
<s> he had em stowed away somehows
<s> giv him by friends i expect
<s> i wish said the other with a bitter curse upon the cold that i had em here
<s> two one pound notes or friends
<s> two one pound notes
<s> i d sell all the friends i ever had for one and think it a blessed good bargain
<s> well so he says
<s> so he says resumed the convict i had recognised it was all said and done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the dock yard you re a going to be discharged yes i was
<s> would i find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two one pound notes yes i would
<s> and i did
<s> more fool you growled the other
<s> i d have spent em on a man in wittles and drink
<s> he must have been a green one
<s> mean to say he knowed nothing of you
<s> not a ha porth
<s> different gangs and different ships
<s> he was tried again for prison breaking and got made a lifer
<s> and was that honour the only time you worked out in this part of the country
<s> the only time
<s> what might have been your opinion of the place
<s> a most beastly place
<s> mudbank mist swamp and work work swamp mist and mudbank
<s> they both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually growled themselves out and had nothing left to say
<s> after overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity
<s> indeed i was not only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help
<s> still the coincidence of our being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his hearing with my name
<s> for this reason i resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing
<s> this device i executed successfully
<s> my little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet i had but to turn a hinge to get it out i threw it down before me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement
<s> as to the convicts they went their way with the coach and i knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river
<s> in my fancy i saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime washed stairs again heard the gruff give way you like and order to dogs again saw the wicked noah s ark lying out on the black water
<s> i could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me
<s> as i walked on to the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble
<s> i am confident that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood
<s> the coffee room at the blue boar was empty and i had not only ordered my dinner there but had sat down to it before the waiter knew me
<s> as soon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory he asked me if he should send boots for mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> no said i certainly not
<s> the waiter it was he who had brought up the great remonstrance from the commercials on the day when i was bound appeared surprised and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way that i took it up and read this paragraph
<s> our readers will learn not altogether without interest in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighbourhood what a theme by the way for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman tooby the poet of our columns that the youth s earliest patron companion and friend was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the high street
<s> it is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record him as the mentor of our young telemachus for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter s fortunes
<s> does the thought contracted brow of the local sage or the lustrous eye of local beauty inquire whose fortunes we believe that quintin matsys was the blacksmith of antwerp
<s> verb
<s> sap
<s> i entertain a conviction based upon large experience that if in the days of my prosperity i had gone to the north pole i should have met somebody there wandering esquimaux or civilized man who would have told me that pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes
<s> chapter xxix
<s> betimes in the morning i was up and out
<s> it was too early yet to go to miss havisham s so i loitered into the country on miss havisham s side of town which was not joe s side i could go there to morrow thinking about my patroness and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me
<s> she had adopted estella she had as good as adopted me and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together
<s> she reserved it for me to restore the desolate house admit the sunshine into the dark rooms set the clocks a going and the cold hearths a blazing tear down the cobwebs destroy the vermin in short do all the shining deeds of the young knight of romance and marry the princess
<s> i had stopped to look at the house as i passed and its seared red brick walls blocked windows and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arms had made up a rich attractive mystery of which i was the hero
<s> estella was the inspiration of it and the heart of it of course
<s> but though she had taken such strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all powerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her with any attributes save those she possessed
<s> i mention this in this place of a fixed purpose because it is the clue by which i am to be followed into my poor labyrinth
<s> according to my experience the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true
<s> the unqualified truth is that when i loved estella with the love of a man i loved her simply because i found her irresistible
<s> once for all i knew to my sorrow often and often if not always that i loved her against reason against promise against peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that could be
<s> once for all i loved her none the less because i knew it and it had no more influence in restraining me than if i had devoutly believed her to be human perfection
<s> i so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time
<s> when i had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the gate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet
<s> i heard the side door open and steps come across the courtyard but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges
<s> being at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned
<s> i started much more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober grey dress
<s> the last man i should have expected to see in that place of porter at miss havisham s door
<s> orlick
<s> ah young master there s more changes than yours
<s> but come in come in
<s> it s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open
<s> i entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out
<s> yes said he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house
<s> here i am
<s> how did you come here
<s> i come here he retorted on my legs
<s> i had my box brought alongside me in a barrow
<s> are you here for good
<s> i ain t here for harm young master i suppose
<s> i was not so sure of that
<s> i had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my legs and arms to my face
<s> then you have left the forge i said
<s> do this look like a forge replied orlick sending his glance all round him with an air of injury
<s> now do it look like it
<s> i asked him how long he had left gargery s forge
<s> one day is so like another here he replied that i don t know without casting it up
<s> however i come here some time since you left
<s> i could have told you that orlick
<s> ah said he dryly
<s> but then you ve got to be a scholar
<s> by this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one just within the side door with a little window in it looking on the courtyard
<s> in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate porter in paris
<s> certain keys were hanging on the wall to which he now added the gate key and his patchwork covered bed was in a little inner division or recess
<s> the whole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look like a cage for a human dormouse while he looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up as indeed he was
<s> i never saw this room before i remarked but there used to be no porter here
<s> no said he not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convicts and tag and rag and bobtail going up and down
<s> and then i was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought and i took it
<s> it s easier than bellowsing and hammering
<s> that s loaded that is
<s> my eye had been caught by a gun with a brass bound stock over the chimney piece and his eye had followed mine
<s> well said i not desirous of more conversation shall i go up to miss havisham
<s> burn me if i know he retorted first stretching himself and then shaking himself my orders ends here young master
<s> i give this here bell a rap with this here hammer and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody
<s> i am expected i believe
<s> burn me twice over if i can say said he
<s> upon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in my thick boots and he made his bell sound
<s> at the end of the passage while the bell was still reverberating i found sarah pocket who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me
<s> oh said she
<s> you is it mr
<s> pip
<s> it is miss pocket
<s> i am glad to tell you that mr
<s> pocket and family are all well
<s> are they any wiser said sarah with a dismal shake of the head they had better be wiser than well
<s> ah matthew matthew you know your way sir
<s> tolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time
<s> i ascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old way at the door of miss havisham s room
<s> pip s rap i heard her say immediately come in pip
<s> she was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two hands crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eyes on the fire
<s> sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been worn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an elegant lady whom i had never seen
<s> come in pip miss havisham continued to mutter without looking round or up come in pip how do you do pip so you kiss my hand as if i were a queen eh well
<s> she looked up at me suddenly only moving her eyes and repeated in a grimly playful manner
<s> well
<s> i heard miss havisham said i rather at a loss that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directly
<s> well
<s> the lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eyes and looked archly at me and then i saw that the eyes were estella s eyes
<s> but she was so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly in all things winning admiration had made such wonderful advance that i seemed to have made none
<s> i fancied as i looked at her that i slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again
<s> o the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the inaccessibility that came about her
<s> she gave me her hand
<s> i stammered something about the pleasure i felt in seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a long long time
<s> do you find her much changed pip asked miss havisham with her greedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them as a sign to me to sit down there
<s> when i came in miss havisham i thought there was nothing of estella in the face or figure but now it all settles down so curiously into the old
<s> what you are not going to say into the old estella miss havisham interrupted
<s> she was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away from her
<s> don t you remember
<s> i said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better then and the like
<s> estella smiled with perfect composure and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very disagreeable
<s> is he changed miss havisham asked her
<s> very much said estella looking at me
<s> less coarse and common said miss havisham playing with estella s hair
<s> estella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again and looked at me and put the shoe down
<s> she treated me as a boy still but she lured me on
<s> we sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from france and that she was going to london
<s> proud and wilful as of old she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature or i thought so to separate them from her beauty
<s> truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood from all those ill regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and joe from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the anvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge and flit away
<s> in a word it was impossible for me to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life of my life
<s> it was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and return to the hotel at night and to london to morrow
<s> when we had conversed for a while miss havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden on our coming in by and by she said i should wheel her about a little as in times of yore
<s> so estella and i went out into the garden by the gate through which i had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman now herbert i trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress she quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine
<s> as we drew near to the place of encounter she stopped and said
<s> i must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day but i did and i enjoyed it very much
<s> you rewarded me very much
<s> did i she replied in an incidental and forgetful way
<s> i remember i entertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company
<s> he and i are great friends now
<s> are you i think i recollect though that you read with his father
<s> yes
<s> i made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish look and she already treated me more than enough like a boy
<s> since your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your companions said estella
<s> naturally said i
<s> and necessarily she added in a haughty tone what was fit company for you once would be quite unfit company for you now
<s> in my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering intention left of going to see joe but if i had this observation put it to flight
<s> you had no idea of your impending good fortune in those times said estella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting times
<s> not the least
<s> the air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at hers made a contrast that i strongly felt
<s> it would have rankled in me more than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her
<s> the garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again into the brewery yard
<s> i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her walking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and careless look in that direction did i i reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said i don t remember
<s> not remember that you made me cry said i
<s> no said she and shook her head and looked about her
<s> i verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry again inwardly and that is the sharpest crying of all
<s> you must know said estella condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might that i have no heart if that has anything to do with my memory
<s> i got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of doubting that
<s> that i knew better
<s> that there could be no such beauty without it
<s> oh i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in i have no doubt said estella and of course if it ceased to beat i should cease to be
<s> but you know what i mean
<s> i have no softness there no sympathy sentiment nonsense
<s> what was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me anything that i had seen in miss havisham no
<s> in some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to miss havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded and which when childhood is passed will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different
<s> and yet i could not trace this to miss havisham
<s> i looked again and though she was still looking at me the suggestion was gone
<s> what was it
<s> i am serious said estella not so much with a frown for her brow was smooth as with a darkening of her face if we are to be thrown much together you had better believe it at once
<s> no imperiously stopping me as i opened my lips
<s> i have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere
<s> i have never had any such thing
<s> in another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she pointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same first day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to have seen me standing scared below
<s> as my eyes followed her white hand again the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed me
<s> my involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm
<s> instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone
<s> what was it
<s> what is the matter asked estella
<s> are you scared again
<s> i should be if i believed what you said just now i replied to turn it off
<s> then you don t very well
<s> it is said at any rate
<s> miss havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be laid aside now with other old belongings
<s> let us make one more round of the garden and then go in
<s> come you shall not shed tears for my cruelty to day you shall be my page and give me your shoulder
<s> her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground
<s> she held it in one hand now and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked
<s> we walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in bloom for me
<s> if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance
<s> there was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me we were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my delight and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another
<s> wretched boy
<s> at last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise that my guardian had come down to see miss havisham on business and would come back to dinner
<s> the old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out and miss havisham was in her chair and waiting for me
<s> it was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast
<s> but in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her estella looked more bright and beautiful than before and i was under stronger enchantment
<s> the time so melted away that our early dinner hour drew close at hand and estella left us to prepare herself
<s> we had stopped near the centre of the long table and miss havisham with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth
<s> as estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door miss havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful
<s> then estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and said in a whisper
<s> is she beautiful graceful well grown do you admire her
<s> everybody must who sees her miss havisham
<s> she drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair
<s> love her love her love her how does she use you
<s> before i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question at all she repeated love her love her love her if she favours you love her
<s> if she wounds you love her
<s> if she tears your heart to pieces and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper love her love her love her
<s> never had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words
<s> i could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her
<s> hear me pip i adopted her to be loved
<s> i bred her and educated her to be loved
<s> i developed her into what she is that she might be loved
<s> love her
<s> she said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love despair revenge dire death it could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse
<s> i ll tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what real love is
<s> it is blind devotion unquestioning self humiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter as i did
<s> when she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught her round the waist
<s> for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead
<s> all this passed in a few seconds
<s> as i drew her down into her chair i was conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in the room
<s> he always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a pocket handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was of great value to him in his profession
<s> i have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself that the self committal has followed directly quite as a matter of course
<s> when i saw him in the room he had this expressive pocket handkerchief in both hands and was looking at us
<s> on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude indeed singular and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect
<s> miss havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody else afraid of him
<s> she made a strong attempt to compose herself and stammered that he was as punctual as ever
<s> as punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us
<s> how do you do pip shall i give you a ride miss havisham once round and so you are here pip
<s> i told him when i had arrived and how miss havisham had wished me to come and see estella
<s> to which he replied ah very fine young lady then he pushed miss havisham in her chair before him with one of his large hands and put the other in his trousers pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets
<s> well pip how often have you seen miss estella before said he when he came to a stop
<s> how often
<s> ah how many times ten thousand times
<s> oh certainly not so many
<s> twice
<s> jaggers interposed miss havisham much to my relief leave my pip alone and go with him to your dinner
<s> he complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together
<s> while we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss havisham eat and drink offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred times and once
<s> i considered and said never
<s> and never will pip he retorted with a frowning smile
<s> she has never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this present life of hers
<s> she wanders about in the night and then lays hands on such food as she takes
<s> pray sir said i may i ask you a question
<s> you may said he and i may decline to answer it
<s> put your question
<s> estella s name
<s> is it havisham or i had nothing to add
<s> or what said he
<s> is it havisham
<s> it is havisham
<s> this brought us to the dinner table where she and sarah pocket awaited us
<s> mr
<s> jaggers presided estella sat opposite to him i faced my green and yellow friend
<s> we dined very well and were waited on by a maid servant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole time
<s> after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the two ladies left us
<s> anything to equal the determined reticence of mr
<s> jaggers under that roof i never saw elsewhere even in him
<s> he kept his very looks to himself and scarcely directed his eyes to estella s face once during dinner
<s> when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered but never looked at her that i could see
<s> on the other hand she often looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his face never showed the least consciousness
<s> throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making sarah pocket greener and yellower by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he extorted and even did extort though i don t know how those references out of my innocent self
<s> and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that really was too much for me
<s> he cross examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand
<s> he held it between himself and the candle tasted the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and cross examined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage
<s> three or four times i feebly thought i would start conversation but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use for he couldn t answer
<s> i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her cap which was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mop and strewing the ground with her hair which assuredly had never grown on her head
<s> she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss havisham s room and we four played at whist
<s> in the interval miss havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing table into estella s hair and about her bosom and arms and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it
<s> 0242m
<s> of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands before which the glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing nor of the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago
<s> what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards estella
<s> it was not that i knew i could never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see him wash his hands of her it was that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him it was that my feelings should be in the same place with him that was the agonizing circumstance
<s> we played until nine o clock and then it was arranged that when estella came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach and then i took leave of her and touched her and left her
<s> my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine
<s> far into the night miss havisham s words love her love her love her sounded in my ears
<s> i adapted them for my own repetition and said to my pillow i love her i love her i love her hundreds of times
<s> then a burst of gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the blacksmith s boy
<s> then i thought if she were as i feared by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she begin to be interested in me when should i awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now
<s> ah me i thought those were high and great emotions
<s> but i never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from joe because i knew she would be contemptuous of him
<s> it was but a day gone and joe had brought the tears into my eyes they had soon dried god forgive me soon dried

<s> after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue boar in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted orlick s being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss havisham s
<s> why of course he is not the right sort of man pip said my guardian comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man
<s> it seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of orlick
<s> very good pip he observed when i had concluded i ll go round presently and pay our friend off
<s> rather alarmed by this summary action i was for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with
<s> oh no he won t said my guardian making his pocket handkerchief point with perfect confidence i should like to see him argue the question with me
<s> as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i breakfasted under such terrors of pumblechook that i could scarcely hold my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and that i would go on along the london road while mr
<s> jaggers was occupied if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when overtaken
<s> i was thus enabled to fly from the blue boar immediately after breakfast
<s> by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of pumblechook s premises i got round into the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in comparative security
<s> it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared after
<s> one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they had forgotten something and pass me face to face on which occasions i don t know whether they or i made the worse pretence they of not doing it or i of not seeing it
<s> still my position was a distinguished one and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant trabb s boy
<s> casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress i beheld trabb s boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag
<s> deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating myself on my success when suddenly the knees of trabb s boy smote together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace hold me i m so frightened feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance
<s> as i passed him his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust
<s> this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing
<s> i had not advanced another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement and indignation i again beheld trabb s boy approaching
<s> he was coming round a narrow corner
<s> his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest industry beamed in his eyes a determination to proceed to trabb s with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait
<s> with a shock he became aware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy
<s> his sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators and i felt utterly confounded
<s> i had not got as much further down the street as the post office when i again beheld trabb s boy shooting round by a back way
<s> this time he was entirely changed
<s> he wore the blue bag in the manner of my great coat and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand don t know yah words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by trabb s boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his shirt collar twined his side hair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his attendants don t know yah don t know yah pon my soul don t know yah the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to speak ejected by it into the open country
<s> 0245m
<s> but unless i had taken the life of trabb s boy on that occasion i really do not even now see what i could have done save endure
<s> to have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart s best blood would have been futile and degrading
<s> moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew out again between his captor s legs scornfully yelping
<s> i wrote however to mr
<s> trabb by next day s post to say that mr
<s> pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing in every respectable mind
<s> the coach with mr
<s> jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my box seat again and arrived in london safe but not sound for my heart was gone
<s> as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to joe as reparation for not having gone myself and then went on to barnard s inn
<s> i found herbert dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back
<s> having despatched the avenger to the coffee house for an addition to the dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum
<s> as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole i sent him to the play
<s> a better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him employment
<s> so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park corner to see what o clock it was
<s> dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender i said to herbert my dear herbert i have something very particular to tell you
<s> my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your confidence
<s> it concerns myself herbert said i and one other person
<s> herbert crossed his feet looked at the fire with his head on one side and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i didn t go on
<s> herbert said i laying my hand upon his knee i love i adore estella
<s> instead of being transfixed herbert replied in an easy matter of course way exactly
<s> well
<s> well herbert is that all you say well
<s> what next i mean said herbert
<s> of course i know that
<s> how do you know it said i
<s> how do i know it handel why from you
<s> i never told you
<s> told me you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i have had senses to perceive it
<s> you have always adored her ever since i have known you
<s> you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together
<s> told me why you have always told me all day long
<s> when you told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed
<s> very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light i have never left off adoring her
<s> and she has come back a most beautiful and most elegant creature
<s> and i saw her yesterday
<s> and if i adored her before i now doubly adore her
<s> lucky for you then handel said herbert that you are picked out for her and allotted to her
<s> without encroaching on forbidden ground we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact
<s> have you any idea yet of estella s views on the adoration question
<s> i shook my head gloomily
<s> oh she is thousands of miles away from me said i
<s> patience my dear handel time enough time enough
<s> but you have something more to say
<s> i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet it s no worse to say it than to think it
<s> you call me a lucky fellow
<s> of course i am
<s> i was a blacksmith s boy but yesterday i am what shall i say i am to day
<s> say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert smiling and clapping his hand on the back of mine a good fellow with impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and dreaming curiously mixed in him
<s> i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character
<s> on the whole i by no means recognised the analysis but thought it not worth disputing
<s> when i ask what i am to call myself to day herbert i went on i suggest what i have in my thoughts
<s> you say i am lucky
<s> i know i have done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised me that is being very lucky
<s> and yet when i think of estella
<s> and when don t you you know herbert threw in with his eyes on the fire which i thought kind and sympathetic of him
<s> then my dear herbert i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances
<s> avoiding forbidden ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend
<s> and at the best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what they are in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday
<s> now handel herbert replied in his gay hopeful way it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our gift horse s mouth with a magnifying glass
<s> likewise it seems to me that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal
<s> didn t you tell me that your guardian mr
<s> jaggers told you in the beginning that you were not endowed with expectations only and even if he had not told you so though that is a very large if i grant could you believe that of all men in london mr
<s> jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground
<s> i said i could not deny that this was a strong point
<s> i said it people often do so in such cases like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice as if i wanted to deny it
<s> i should think it was a strong point said herbert and i should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you must bide your guardian s time and he must bide his client s time
<s> you ll be one and twenty before you know where you are and then perhaps you ll get some further enlightenment
<s> at all events you ll be nearer getting it for it must come at last
<s> what a hopeful disposition you have said i gratefully admiring his cheery ways
<s> i ought to have said herbert for i have not much else
<s> i must acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is not my own but my father s
<s> the only remark i ever heard him make on your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or mr
<s> jaggers would not be in it
<s> and now before i say anything more about my father or my father s son and repay confidence with confidence i want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment positively repulsive
<s> you won t succeed said i
<s> o yes i shall said he
<s> one two three and now i am in for it
<s> handel my good fellow though he spoke in this light tone he was very much in earnest i have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender that estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian
<s> am i right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never referred to her directly or indirectly in any way never even hinted for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately
<s> never
<s> now handel i am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes upon my soul and honour not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from her i told you i should be disagreeable
<s> i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly rising and when i laid my hand upon the village finger post smote upon my heart again
<s> there was silence between us for a little while
<s> yes but my dear handel herbert went on as if we had been talking instead of silent its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic renders it very serious
<s> think of her bringing up and think of miss havisham
<s> think of what she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me
<s> this may lead to miserable things
<s> i know it herbert said i with my head still turned away but i can t help it
<s> you can t detach yourself
<s> no
<s> impossible
<s> you can t try handel
<s> no
<s> impossible
<s> well said herbert getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep and stirring the fire now i ll endeavour to make myself agreeable again
<s> so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chairs in their places tidied the books and so forth that were lying about looked into the hall peeped into the letter box shut the door and came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left leg in both arms
<s> i was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my father s son
<s> i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father s son to remark that my father s establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping
<s> there is always plenty herbert said i to say something encouraging
<s> o yes and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest approval and so does the marine store shop in the back street
<s> gravely handel for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as i do
<s> i suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up but if ever there was the time is gone
<s> may i ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married
<s> this was such a singular question that i asked him in return is it so
<s> i don t know said herbert that s what i want to know
<s> because it is decidedly the case with us
<s> my poor sister charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen was a striking example
<s> little jane is the same
<s> in her desire to be matrimonially established you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss
<s> little alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew
<s> and indeed i think we are all engaged except the baby
<s> then you are said i
<s> i am said herbert but it s a secret
<s> i assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favoured with further particulars
<s> he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength
<s> may i ask the name i said
<s> name of clara said herbert
<s> live in london
<s> yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert who had become curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting theme that she is rather below my mother s nonsensical family notions
<s> her father had to do with the victualling of passenger ships
<s> i think he was a species of purser
<s> what is he now said i
<s> he s an invalid now replied herbert
<s> living on
<s> on the first floor said herbert
<s> which was not at all what i meant for i had intended my question to apply to his means
<s> i have never seen him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known clara
<s> but i have heard him constantly
<s> he makes tremendous rows roars and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument
<s> in looking at me and then laughing heartily herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner
<s> don t you expect to see him said i
<s> o yes i constantly expect to see him returned herbert because i never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling
<s> but i don t know how long the rafters may hold
<s> when he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told me that the moment he began to realise capital it was his intention to marry this young lady
<s> he added as a self evident proposition engendering low spirits but you can t marry you know while you re looking about you
<s> as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to realise this same capital sometimes was i put my hands in my pockets
<s> a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention i opened it and found it to be the play bill i had received from joe relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown
<s> and bless my heart i involuntarily added aloud it s to night
<s> this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play
<s> so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means and when herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of mr
<s> wopsle and denmark
<s> chapter xxxi
<s> on our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm chairs on a kitchen table holding a court
<s> the whole of the danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble boy in the wash leather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance
<s> my gifted townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arms and i could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable
<s> several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded
<s> the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him to the tomb and to have brought it back
<s> the royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality
<s> it was this i conceive which led to the shade s being advised by the gallery to turn over a recommendation which it took extremely ill
<s> it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall
<s> this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively
<s> the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another and each of her arms by another so that she was openly mentioned as the kettle drum
<s> the noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able seaman a strolling actor a grave digger a clergyman and a person of the utmost importance at a court fencing match on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged
<s> this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and even on his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral service to the general indignation taking the form of nuts
<s> lastly ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled now the baby s put to bed let s have supper which to say the least of it was out of keeping
<s> upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect
<s> whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or state a doubt the public helped him out with it
<s> as for example on the question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for it and quite a debating society arose
<s> when he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged with loud cries of hear hear when he appeared with his stocking disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him
<s> on his taking the recorders very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door he was called upon unanimously for rule britannia
<s> when he recommended the player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and don t you do it neither you re a deal worse than him and i grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted mr
<s> wopsle on every one of these occasions
<s> but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash house on one side and a turnpike gate on the other
<s> mr
<s> wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out here s the undertaker a coming to see how you re a getting on with your work i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that mr
<s> wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment wai ter the arrival of the body for interment in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of an individual obnoxious to identification
<s> the joy attended mr
<s> wopsle through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen table and had died by inches from the ankles upward
<s> we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud mr
<s> wopsle but they were too hopeless to be persisted in
<s> therefore we had sat feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear
<s> i laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in mr
<s> wopsle s elocution not for old associations sake i am afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything
<s> when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said to herbert let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him
<s> we made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough either
<s> standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow who caught my eyes as we advanced and said when we came up with him
<s> mr
<s> pip and friend
<s> identity of mr
<s> pip and friend confessed
<s> mr
<s> waldengarver said the man would be glad to have the honour
<s> waldengarver i repeated when herbert murmured in my ear probably wopsle
<s> oh said i
<s> yes
<s> shall we follow you
<s> a few steps please
<s> when we were in a side alley he turned and asked how did you think he looked i dressed him
<s> i don t know what he had looked like except a funeral with the addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary fire office
<s> but i said he had looked very nice
<s> when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak beautiful
<s> but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queen s apartment he might have made more of his stockings
<s> i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door into a sort of hot packing case immediately behind it
<s> here mr
<s> wopsle was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another s shoulders by keeping the packing case door or lid wide open
<s> gentlemen said mr
<s> wopsle i am proud to see you
<s> i hope mr
<s> pip you will excuse my sending round
<s> i had the happiness to know you in former times and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged on the noble and the affluent
<s> meanwhile mr
<s> waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to get himself out of his princely sables
<s> skin the stockings off mr
<s> waldengarver said the owner of that property or you ll bust em
<s> bust em and you ll bust five and thirty shillings
<s> shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair
<s> keep quiet in your chair now and leave em to me
<s> with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who on the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow
<s> i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play
<s> but then mr
<s> waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said
<s> gentlemen how did it seem to you to go in front
<s> herbert said from behind at the same time poking me capitally
<s> so i said capitally
<s> how did you like my reading of the character gentlemen said mr
<s> waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage
<s> herbert said from behind again poking me massive and concrete
<s> so i said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it massive and concrete
<s> i am glad to have your approbation gentlemen said mr
<s> waldengarver with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time and holding on by the seat of the chair
<s> but i ll tell you one thing mr
<s> waldengarver said the man who was on his knees in which you re out in your reading
<s> now mind i don t care who says contrairy i tell you so
<s> you re out in your reading of hamlet when you get your legs in profile
<s> the last hamlet as i dressed made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which was the last i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever his reading brought him into profile i called out i don t see no wafers and at night his reading was lovely
<s> mr
<s> waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful dependent i overlook his folly and then said aloud my view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve they will improve
<s> herbert and i said together o no doubt they would improve
<s> did you observe gentlemen said mr
<s> waldengarver that there was a man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service i mean the representation
<s> we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man
<s> i added he was drunk no doubt
<s> o dear no sir said mr
<s> wopsle not drunk
<s> his employer would see to that sir
<s> his employer would not allow him to be drunk
<s> you know his employer said i
<s> mr
<s> wopsle shut his eyes and opened them again performing both ceremonies very slowly
<s> you must have observed gentlemen said he an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity who went through i will not say sustained the rôle if i may use a french expression of claudius king of denmark
<s> that is his employer gentlemen
<s> such is the profession
<s> without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for mr
<s> wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on which jostled us out at the doorway to ask herbert what he thought of having him home to supper herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so therefore i invited him and he went to barnard s with us wrapped up to the eyes and we did our best for him and he sat until two o clock in the morning reviewing his success and developing his plans
<s> i forget in detail what they were but i have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope
<s> miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of estella and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i had to give my hand in marriage to herbert s clara or play hamlet to miss havisham s ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing twenty words of it
<s> chapter xxxii
<s> one day when i was busy with my books and mr
<s> pocket i received a note by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed i divined whose hand it was
<s> it had no set beginning as dear mr
<s> pip or dear pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus
<s> i am to come to london the day after to morrow by the midday coach
<s> i believe it was settled you should meet me at all events miss havisham has that impression and i write in obedience to it
<s> she sends you her regard
<s> yours estella
<s> if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion but as there was not i was fain to be content with those i had
<s> my appetite vanished instantly and i knew no peace or rest until the day arrived
<s> not that its arrival brought me either for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the coach office in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the blue boar in our town
<s> for all that i knew this perfectly well i still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason i had performed the first half hour of a watch of four or five hours when wemmick ran against me
<s> halloa mr
<s> pip said he how do you do i should hardly have thought this was your beat
<s> i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged
<s> both flourishing thankye said wemmick and particularly the aged
<s> he s in wonderful feather
<s> he ll be eighty two next birthday
<s> i have a notion of firing eighty two times if the neighbourhood shouldn t complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure
<s> however this is not london talk
<s> where do you think i am going to
<s> to the office said i for he was tending in that direction
<s> next thing to it returned wemmick i am going to newgate
<s> we are in a banker s parcel case just at present and i have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word or two with our client
<s> did your client commit the robbery i asked
<s> bless your soul and body no answered wemmick very drily
<s> but he is accused of it
<s> so might you or i be
<s> either of us might be accused of it you know
<s> only neither of us is i remarked
<s> yah said wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger you re a deep one mr
<s> pip would you like to have a look at newgate have you time to spare
<s> i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach office
<s> muttering that i would make the inquiry whether i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected which i knew beforehand quite as well as he
<s> i then rejoined mr
<s> wemmick and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i had received accepted his offer
<s> we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules into the interior of the jail
<s> at that time jails were much neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment was still far off
<s> so felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their soup
<s> it was visiting time when wemmick took me in and a potman was going his rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying beer and talking to friends and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing scene it was
<s> it struck me that wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants
<s> this was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain tom are you there ah indeed and also is that black bill behind the cistern why i didn t look for you these two months how do you find yourself equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers always singly wemmick with his post office in an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial
<s> he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department of mr
<s> jaggers s business though something of the state of mr
<s> jaggers hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits
<s> his personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands and then tightening the post office and putting his hands in his pockets
<s> in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees and then mr
<s> wemmick backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced said it s no use my boy
<s> i m only a subordinate
<s> i can t take it
<s> don t go on in that way with a subordinate
<s> if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may be worth the while of another that s my recommendation to you speaking as a subordinate
<s> don t try on useless measures
<s> why should you now who s next
<s> thus we walked through wemmick s greenhouse until he turned to me and said notice the man i shall shake hands with
<s> i should have done so without the preparation as he had shaken hands with no one yet
<s> almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can see now as i write in a well worn olive coloured frock coat with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner of the bars and put his hand to his hat which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth with a half serious and half jocose military salute
<s> colonel to you said wemmick how are you colonel
<s> all right mr
<s> wemmick
<s> everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong for us colonel
<s> yes it was too strong sir but i don t care
<s> no no said wemmick coolly you don t care
<s> then turning to me served his majesty this man
<s> was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge
<s> i said indeed and the man s eyes looked at me and then looked over my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed
<s> i think i shall be out of this on monday sir he said to wemmick
<s> perhaps returned my friend but there s no knowing
<s> i am glad to have the chance of bidding you good bye mr
<s> wemmick said the man stretching out his hand between two bars
<s> thankye said wemmick shaking hands with him
<s> same to you colonel
<s> if what i had upon me when taken had been real mr
<s> wemmick said the man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favour of your wearing another ring in acknowledgment of your attentions
<s> i ll accept the will for the deed said wemmick
<s> by the by you were quite a pigeon fancier
<s> the man looked up at the sky
<s> i am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers
<s> could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair if you ve no further use for em
<s> it shall be done sir
<s> all right said wemmick they shall be taken care of
<s> good afternoon colonel
<s> good bye they shook hands again and as we walked away wemmick said to me a coiner a very good workman
<s> the recorder s report is made to day and he is sure to be executed on monday
<s> still you see as far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same
<s> with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place
<s> as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less than by those whom they held in charge
<s> well mr
<s> wemmick said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other what s mr
<s> jaggers going to do with that water side murder is he going to make it manslaughter or what s he going to make of it
<s> why don t you ask him returned wemmick
<s> o yes i dare say said the turnkey
<s> now that s the way with them here mr
<s> pip remarked wemmick turning to me with his post office elongated
<s> they don t mind what they ask of me the subordinate but you ll never catch em asking any questions of my principal
<s> is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled ones of your office asked the turnkey with a grin at mr
<s> wemmick s humour
<s> there he goes again you see cried wemmick i told you so asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry well supposing mr
<s> pip is one of them
<s> why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what mr
<s> jaggers is
<s> yah cried wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way you re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal you know you are
<s> let us out you old fox or i ll get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment
<s> the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street
<s> mind you mr
<s> pip said wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm to be more confidential i don t know that mr
<s> jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high
<s> he s always so high
<s> his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities
<s> that colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case
<s> then between his height and them he slips in his subordinate don t you see and so he has em soul and body
<s> i was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardian s subtlety
<s> to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the first time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities
<s> mr
<s> wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where suppliants for mr
<s> jaggers s notice were lingering about as usual and i returned to my watch in the street of the coach office with some three hours on hand
<s> i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime that in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening i should have first encountered it that it should have reappeared on two occasions starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement
<s> while my mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young estella proud and refined coming towards me and i thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her
<s> i wished that wemmick had not met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone with him so that of all days in the year on this day i might not have had newgate in my breath and on my clothes
<s> i beat the prison dust off my feet as i sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled its air from my lungs
<s> so contaminated did i feel remembering who was coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of mr
<s> wemmick s conservatory when i saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me
<s> what was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed
<s> chapter xxxiii
<s> in her furred travelling dress estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet even in my eyes
<s> her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i saw miss havisham s influence in the change
<s> we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and when it was all collected i remembered having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile that i knew nothing of her destination
<s> i am going to richmond she told me
<s> our lesson is that there are two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the surrey richmond
<s> the distance is ten miles
<s> i am to have a carriage and you are to take me
<s> this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out of it
<s> o you must take the purse we have no choice you and i but to obey our instructions
<s> we are not free to follow our own devices you and i
<s> as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an inner meaning in her words
<s> she said them slightingly but not with displeasure
<s> a carriage will have to be sent for estella
<s> will you rest here a little
<s> yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you are to take care of me the while
<s> she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life to show us a private sitting room
<s> upon that he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clue without which he couldn t find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article considering the hole s proportions an anchovy sauce cruet and somebody s pattens
<s> on my objecting to this retreat he took us into another room with a dinner table for thirty and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy book under a bushel of coal dust
<s> having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order which proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind
<s> i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong combination of stable with soup stock might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department
<s> yet the room was all in all to me estella being in it
<s> i thought that with her i could have been happy there for life
<s> i was not at all happy there at the time observe and i knew it well
<s> where are you going to at richmond i asked estella
<s> i am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there who has the power or says she has of taking me about and introducing me and showing people to me and showing me to people
<s> i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration
<s> yes i suppose so
<s> she answered so carelessly that i said you speak of yourself as if you were some one else
<s> where did you learn how i speak of others come come said estella smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to you i must talk in my own way
<s> how do you thrive with mr
<s> pocket
<s> i live quite pleasantly there at least it appeared to me that i was losing a chance
<s> at least repeated estella
<s> as pleasantly as i could anywhere away from you
<s> you silly boy said estella quite composedly how can you talk such nonsense your friend mr
<s> matthew i believe is superior to the rest of his family
<s> very superior indeed
<s> he is nobody s enemy
<s> don t add but his own interposed estella for i hate that class of man
<s> but he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite i have heard
<s> i am sure i have every reason to say so
<s> you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying for they beset miss havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage
<s> they watch you misrepresent you write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives
<s> you can scarcely realise to yourself the hatred those people feel for you
<s> they do me no harm i hope
<s> instead of answering estella burst out laughing
<s> this was very singular to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity
<s> when she left off and she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoyment i said in my diffident way with her
<s> i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm
<s> no no you may be sure of that said estella
<s> you may be certain that i laugh because they fail
<s> o those people with miss havisham and the tortures they undergo she laughed again and even now when she had told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion
<s> i thought there must really be something more here than i knew she saw the thought in my mind and answered it
<s> it is not easy for even you
<s> said estella to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous
<s> for you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby
<s> i was
<s> you had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing
<s> i had
<s> you did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night
<s> i did
<s> it was no laughing matter with estella now nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place
<s> i would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap
<s> two things i can tell you said estella
<s> first notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set your mind at rest that these people never will never would in a hundred years impair your ground with miss havisham in any particular great or small
<s> second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it
<s> as she gave it to me playfully for her darker mood had been but momentary i held it and put it to my lips
<s> you ridiculous boy said estella will you never take warning or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek
<s> what spirit was that said i
<s> i must think a moment
<s> a spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters
<s> if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again
<s> you should have asked before you touched the hand
<s> but yes if you like
<s> i leaned down and her calm face was like a statue s
<s> now said estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond
<s> her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our intercourse did give me pain
<s> whatever her tone with me happened to be i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet i went on against trust and against hope
<s> why repeat it a thousand times so it always was
<s> i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clue brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of tea not a glimpse
<s> a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and forks including carvers spoons various salt cellars a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with expressing in his countenance burden and suffering
<s> after a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs
<s> these i steeped in hot water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i don t know what for estella
<s> the bill paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten and the chambermaid taken into consideration in a word the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and estella s purse much lightened we got into our post coach and drove away
<s> turning into cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the walls of which i was so ashamed
<s> what place is that estella asked me
<s> i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it and then told her
<s> as she looked at it and drew in her head again murmuring wretches i would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration
<s> mr
<s> jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in london
<s> he is more in the secrets of every place i think said estella in a low voice
<s> you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose
<s> i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since i can remember
<s> but i know him no better now than i did before i could speak plainly
<s> what is your own experience of him do you advance with him
<s> once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very well
<s> are you intimate
<s> i have dined with him at his private house
<s> i fancy said estella shrinking that must be a curious place
<s> it is a curious place
<s> i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas
<s> it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling i had had before and when we were out of it i was as much dazed for a few moments as if i had been in lightning
<s> so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling and about what parts of london lay on this side of it and what on that
<s> the great city was almost new to her she told me for she had never left miss havisham s neighbourhood until she had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in going and returning
<s> i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here to that she emphatically said god forbid and no more
<s> it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task had needed pains
<s> yet this made me none the happier for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away
<s> when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where mr
<s> matthew pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i hoped i should see her sometimes
<s> o yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned
<s> i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of
<s> no there are only two mother and daughter
<s> the mother is a lady of some station though not averse to increasing her income
<s> i wonder miss havisham could part with you again so soon
<s> it is a part of miss havisham s plans for me pip said estella with a sigh as if she were tired i am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how i go on i and the jewels for they are nearly all mine now
<s> it was the first time she had ever called me by my name
<s> of course she did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up
<s> we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house by the green a staid old house where hoops and powder and patches embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their court days many a time
<s> some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest
<s> a bell with an old voice which i dare say in its time had often said to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamond hilted sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire sounded gravely in the moonlight and two cherry coloured maids came fluttering out to receive estella
<s> the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she gave me her hand and a smile and said good night and was absorbed likewise
<s> and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy with her but always miserable
<s> i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in with a bad heart ache and i got out with a worse heart ache
<s> at our own door i found little jane pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover and i envied her little lover in spite of his being subject to flopson
<s> mr
<s> pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text books on those themes
<s> but mrs
<s> pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of the baby s having been accommodated with a needle case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards of millers
<s> and more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic
<s> mr
<s> pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heart ache of begging him to accept my confidence
<s> but happening to look up at mrs
<s> pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign remedy for baby i thought well no i wouldn t
<s> chapter xxxiv
<s> as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me
<s> their influence on my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible but i knew very well that it was not all good
<s> i lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to joe
<s> my conscience was not by any means comfortable about biddy
<s> when i woke up in the night like camilla i used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should have been happier and better if i had never seen miss havisham s face and had risen to manhood content to be partners with joe in the honest old forge
<s> many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home
<s> yet estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production
<s> that is to say supposing i had had no expectations and yet had had estella to think of i could not make out to my satisfaction that i should have done much better
<s> now concerning the influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so i perceived though dimly enough perhaps that it was not beneficial to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert
<s> my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets
<s> i was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them slumbering
<s> but herbert s was a very different case and it often caused me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing the canary breasted avenger at his disposal
<s> so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began to contract a quantity of debt
<s> i could hardly begin but herbert must begin too so he soon followed
<s> at startop s suggestion we put ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs
<s> i know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert and i understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society which ran gentlemen may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove
<s> the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honour of joining the grove was bentley drummle at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners
<s> occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron and i saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional way like coals
<s> but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age
<s> in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken herbert s expenses on myself but herbert was proud and i could make no such proposal to him
<s> so he got into difficulties in every direction and continued to look about him
<s> when we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast time that he began to look about him more hopefully about midday that he drooped when he came into dinner that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after dinner that he all but realised capital towards midnight and that at about two o clock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune
<s> i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by
<s> herbert would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet
<s> but in the general tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was a thing to transact itself somehow
<s> in the meantime mr
<s> pocket grew greyer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair
<s> while mrs
<s> pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read her book of dignities lost her pocket handkerchief told us about her grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice
<s> as i am now generalising a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at barnard s inn
<s> we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us
<s> we were always more or less miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition
<s> there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did
<s> to the best of my belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one
<s> every morning with an air ever new herbert went into the city to look about him
<s> i often paid him a visit in the dark back room in which he consorted with an ink jar a hat peg a coal box a string box an almanac a desk and stool and a ruler and i do not remember that i ever saw him do anything else but look about him
<s> if we all did what we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert did we might live in a republic of the virtues
<s> he had nothing else to do poor fellow except at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloyd s in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think
<s> he never did anything else in connection with lloyd s that i could find out except come back again
<s> when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively must find an opening he would go on change at a busy time and walk in and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled magnates
<s> for says herbert to me coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions i find the truth to be handel that an opening won t come to one but one must go to it so i have been
<s> if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated one another regularly every morning
<s> i detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the sight of the avenger s livery which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four and twenty hours
<s> as we got more and more into debt breakfast became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at breakfast time threatened by letter with legal proceedings not unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet so that he was actually in the air like a booted cupid for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll
<s> at certain times meaning at uncertain times for they depended on our humour i would say to herbert as if it were a remarkable discovery
<s> my dear herbert we are getting on badly
<s> my dear handel herbert would say to me in all sincerity if you will believe me those very words were on my lips by a strange coincidence
<s> then herbert i would respond let us look into our affairs
<s> we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose
<s> i always thought this was business this was the way to confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat
<s> and i know herbert thought so too
<s> we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark
<s> dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper
<s> for there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery
<s> i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a neat hand the heading memorandum of pip s debts with barnard s inn and the date very carefully added
<s> herbert would also take a sheet of paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of herbert s debts
<s> each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pockets half burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the looking glass and otherwise damaged
<s> the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money
<s> in point of meritorious character the two things seemed about equal
<s> when we had written a little while i would ask herbert how he got on herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures
<s> they are mounting up handel herbert would say upon my life they are mounting up
<s> be firm herbert i would retort plying my own pen with great assiduity
<s> look the thing in the face
<s> look into your affairs
<s> stare them out of countenance
<s> so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance
<s> however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert would fall to work again
<s> after a time he would give up once more on the plea that he had not got cobbs s bill or lobbs s or nobbs s as the case might be
<s> then herbert estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it down
<s> what a fellow of resource you are my friend would reply with admiration
<s> really your business powers are very remarkable
<s> i thought so too
<s> i established with myself on these occasions the reputation of a first rate man of business prompt decisive energetic clear cool headed
<s> when i had got all my responsibilities down upon my list i compared each with the bill and ticked it off
<s> my self approval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation
<s> when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle
<s> then i did the same for herbert who modestly said he had not my administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a focus for him
<s> my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving a margin
<s> for example supposing herbert s debts to be one hundred and sixty four pounds four and twopence i would say leave a margin and put them down at two hundred
<s> or supposing my own to be four times as much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred
<s> i had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin but i am bound to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have been an expensive device
<s> for we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted got pretty far on into another margin
<s> but there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable opinion of myself
<s> soothed by my exertions my method and herbert s compliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationery and feel like a bank of some sort rather than a private individual
<s> we shut our outer door on these solemn occasions in order that we might not be interrupted
<s> i had fallen into my serene state one evening when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on the ground
<s> it s for you handel said herbert going out and coming back with it and i hope there is nothing the matter
<s> this was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border
<s> the letter was signed trabb co
<s> and its contents were simply that i was an honoured sir and that they begged to inform me that mrs
<s> j
<s> gargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on monday next at three o clock in the afternoon
<s> chapter xxxv
<s> it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful
<s> the figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day
<s> that the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late i had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door
<s> in my rooms too with which she had never been at all associated there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were still alive and had been often there
<s> whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness
<s> but i suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness
<s> under its influence and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully pursued orlick or any one else to the last extremity
<s> having written to joe to offer him consolation and to assure him that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind i have glanced at
<s> i went down early in the morning and alighted at the blue boar in good time to walk over to the forge
<s> it was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the times when i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me vividly returned
<s> but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of tickler
<s> for now the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me
<s> at last i came within sight of the house and saw that trabb and co
<s> had put in a funereal execution and taken possession
<s> two dismally absurd persons each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody were posted at the front door and in one of them i recognised a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms
<s> all the children of the village and most of the women were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy knocked at the door implying that i was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself
<s> another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlour
<s> here mr
<s> trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity of black pins
<s> at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting somebody s hat into black long clothes like an african baby so he held out his hand for mine
<s> but i misled by the action and confused by the occasion shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection
<s> poor dear joe entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by trabb
<s> when i bent down and said to him dear joe how are you he said pip old chap you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and clasped my hand and said no more
<s> biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly here and there and was very helpful
<s> when i had spoken to biddy as i thought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near joe and there began to wonder in what part of the house it she my sister was
<s> the air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet cake i looked about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cut up plum cake upon it and there were cut up oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used in all my life one full of port and one of sherry
<s> standing at this table i became conscious of the servile pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself and making obsequious movements to catch my attention
<s> the moment he succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said in a subdued voice may i dear sir and did
<s> i then descried mr
<s> and mrs
<s> hubble the last named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner
<s> we were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up separately by trabb into ridiculous bundles
<s> which i meantersay pip joe whispered me as we were being what mr
<s> trabb called formed in the parlour two and two and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance which i meantersay sir as i would in preference have carried her to the church myself along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms but it were considered wot the neighbours would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect
<s> pocket handkerchiefs out all cried mr
<s> trabb at this point in a depressed business like voice
<s> pocket handkerchiefs out we are ready
<s> so we all put our pocket handkerchiefs to our faces as if our noses were bleeding and filed out two and two joe and i biddy and pumblechook mr
<s> and mrs
<s> hubble
<s> the remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs shuffling and blundering along under the guidance of two keepers the postboy and his comrade
<s> the neighbourhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage
<s> at such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come here they are and we were all but cheered
<s> in this progress i was much annoyed by the abject pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing my cloak
<s> my thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of mr
<s> and mrs
<s> hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession
<s> and now the range of marshes lay clear before us with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above
<s> and there my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees
<s> of the conduct of the worldly minded pumblechook while this was doing i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property
<s> when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honour and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death
<s> after that he drank all the rest of the sherry and mr
<s> hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since observed to be customary in such cases as if they were of quite another race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal
<s> finally he went away with mr
<s> and mrs
<s> hubble to make an evening of it i felt sure and to tell the jolly bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor
<s> when they were all gone and when trabb and his men but not his boy i looked for him had crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too the house felt wholesomer
<s> soon afterwards biddy joe and i had a cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlour not in the old kitchen and joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great restraint upon us
<s> but after dinner when i made him take his pipe and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better
<s> i noticed that after the funeral joe changed his clothes so far as to make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress in which the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was
<s> he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little room and i was pleased too for i felt that i had done rather a great thing in making the request
<s> when the shadows of evening were closing in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a little talk
<s> biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad matters
<s> do you mr
<s> pip said biddy
<s> i should have written if i had thought that
<s> don t suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider that you ought to have thought that
<s> do you mr
<s> pip
<s> she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again
<s> after looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me i gave up that point
<s> i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear
<s> oh i can t do so mr
<s> pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction
<s> i have been speaking to mrs
<s> hubble and i am going to her to morrow
<s> i hope we shall be able to take some care of mr
<s> gargery together until he settles down
<s> how are you going to live biddy if you want any mo
<s> how am i going to live repeated biddy striking in with a momentary flush upon her face
<s> i ll tell you mr
<s> pip
<s> i am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here
<s> i can be well recommended by all the neighbours and i hope i can be industrious and patient and teach myself while i teach others
<s> you know mr
<s> pip pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eyes to my face the new schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after that time and have had time since then to improve
<s> i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstances
<s> ah except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy
<s> it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud
<s> well i thought i would give up that point too
<s> so i walked a little further with biddy looking silently at her downcast eyes
<s> i have not heard the particulars of my sister s death biddy
<s> they are very slight poor thing
<s> she had been in one of her bad states though they had got better of late rather than worse for four days when she came out of it in the evening just at tea time and said quite plainly joe
<s> as she had never said any word for a long while i ran and fetched in mr
<s> gargery from the forge
<s> she made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arms round his neck
<s> so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied
<s> and so she presently said joe again and once pardon and once pip
<s> and so she never lifted her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed because we found she was gone
<s> biddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were coming out were blurred in my own sight
<s> nothing was ever discovered biddy
<s> nothing
<s> do you know what is become of orlick
<s> i should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in the quarries
<s> of course you have seen him then why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane
<s> i saw him there on the night she died
<s> that was not the last time either biddy
<s> no i have seen him there since we have been walking here
<s> it is of no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running out you know i would not deceive you he was not there a minute and he is gone
<s> it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow and i felt inveterate against him
<s> i told her so and told her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country
<s> by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she told me how joe loved me and how joe never complained of anything she didn t say of me she had no need i knew what she meant but ever did his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a gentle heart
<s> indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i and biddy we must often speak of these things for of course i shall be often down here now
<s> i am not going to leave poor joe alone
<s> biddy said never a single word
<s> biddy don t you hear me
<s> yes mr
<s> pip
<s> not to mention your calling me mr
<s> pip which appears to me to be in bad taste biddy what do you mean
<s> what do i mean asked biddy timidly
<s> biddy said i in a virtuously self asserting manner i must request to know what you mean by this
<s> by this said biddy
<s> now don t echo i retorted
<s> you used not to echo biddy
<s> used not said biddy
<s> o mr
<s> pip used
<s> well i rather thought i would give up that point too
<s> after another silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position
<s> biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often to see joe which you received with a marked silence
<s> have the goodness biddy to tell me why
<s> are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often asked biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye
<s> o dear me said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in despair
<s> this really is a very bad side of human nature don t say any more if you please biddy
<s> this shocks me very much
<s> for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day
<s> as often as i was restless in the night and that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what an injury what an injustice biddy had done me
<s> early in the morning i was to go
<s> early in the morning i was out and looking in unseen at one of the wooden windows of the forge
<s> there i stood for minutes looking at joe already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it
<s> good bye dear joe no don t wipe it off for god s sake give me your blackened hand i shall be down soon and often
<s> 0279m
<s> never too soon sir said joe and never too often pip
<s> biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread
<s> biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting i am not angry but i am hurt
<s> no don t be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically let only me be hurt if i have been ungenerous
<s> once more the mists were rising as i walked away
<s> if they disclosed to me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy was quite right all i can say is they were quite right too
<s> chapter xxxvi
<s> herbert and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary transactions and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing and i came of age in fulfilment of herbert s prediction that i should do so before i knew where i was
<s> herbert himself had come of age eight months before me
<s> as he had nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a profound sensation in barnard s inn
<s> but we had looked forward to my one and twentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion
<s> i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my birthday was
<s> on the day before it i received an official note from wemmick informing me that mr
<s> jaggers would be glad if i would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day
<s> this convinced us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual flutter when i repaired to my guardian s office a model of punctuality
<s> in the outer office wemmick offered me his congratulations and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue paper that i liked the look of
<s> but he said nothing respecting it and motioned me with a nod into my guardian s room
<s> it was november and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney piece with his hands under his coattails
<s> well pip said he i must call you mr
<s> pip to day
<s> congratulations mr
<s> pip
<s> we shook hands he was always a remarkably short shaker and i thanked him
<s> take a chair mr
<s> pip said my guardian
<s> as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when i had been put upon a tombstone
<s> the two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation
<s> now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the box i am going to have a word or two with you
<s> if you please sir
<s> what do you suppose said mr
<s> jaggers bending forward to look at the ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling what do you suppose you are living at the rate of
<s> at the rate of sir
<s> at repeated mr
<s> jaggers still looking at the ceiling the rate of and then looked all round the room and paused with his pocket handkerchief in his hand half way to his nose
<s> i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings
<s> reluctantly i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question
<s> this reply seemed agreeable to mr
<s> jaggers who said i thought so and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction
<s> now i have asked you a question my friend said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> have you anything to ask me
<s> of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions sir but i remember your prohibition
<s> ask one said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> is my benefactor to be made known to me to day
<s> no
<s> ask another
<s> is that confidence to be imparted to me soon
<s> waive that a moment said mr
<s> jaggers and ask another
<s> i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry have i anything to receive sir on that mr
<s> jaggers said triumphantly i thought we should come to it and called to wemmick to give him that piece of paper
<s> wemmick appeared handed it in and disappeared
<s> now mr
<s> pip said mr
<s> jaggers attend if you please
<s> you have been drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in wemmick s cash book but you are in debt of course
<s> i am afraid i must say yes sir
<s> you know you must say yes don t you said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> yes sir
<s> i don t ask you what you owe because you don t know and if you did know you wouldn t tell me you would say less
<s> yes yes my friend cried mr
<s> jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show of protesting it s likely enough that you think you wouldn t but you would
<s> you ll excuse me but i know better than you
<s> now take this piece of paper in your hand
<s> you have got it very good
<s> now unfold it and tell me what it is
<s> this is a bank note said i for five hundred pounds
<s> that is a bank note repeated mr
<s> jaggers for five hundred pounds
<s> and a very handsome sum of money too i think
<s> you consider it so
<s> how could i do otherwise
<s> ah but answer the question said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> undoubtedly
<s> you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money
<s> now that handsome sum of money pip is your own
<s> it is a present to you on this day in earnest of your expectations
<s> and at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the donor of the whole appears
<s> that is to say you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands and you will draw from wemmick one hundred and twenty five pounds per quarter until you are in communication with the fountain head and no longer with the mere agent
<s> as i have told you before i am the mere agent
<s> i execute my instructions and i am paid for doing so
<s> i think them injudicious but i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits
<s> i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which i was treated when mr
<s> jaggers stopped me
<s> i am not paid pip said he coolly to carry your words to any one and then gathered up his coat tails as he had gathered up the subject and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him
<s> after a pause i hinted
<s> there was a question just now mr
<s> jaggers which you desired me to waive for a moment
<s> i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again
<s> what is it said he
<s> i might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new
<s> is it likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountain head you have spoken of mr
<s> jaggers will soon there i delicately stopped
<s> will soon what asked mr
<s> jaggers
<s> that s no question as it stands you know
<s> will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise form of words or summon me anywhere else
<s> now here replied mr
<s> jaggers fixing me for the first time with his dark deep set eyes we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village
<s> what did i tell you then pip
<s> you told me mr
<s> jaggers that it might be years hence when that person appeared
<s> just so said mr
<s> jaggers that s my answer
<s> as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him
<s> and as i felt that it came quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him
<s> do you suppose it will still be years hence mr
<s> jaggers
<s> mr
<s> jaggers shook his head not in negativing the question but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked when my eyes strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention and were going to sneeze
<s> come said mr
<s> jaggers warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands i ll be plain with you my friend pip
<s> that s a question i must not be asked
<s> you ll understand that better when i tell you it s a question that might compromise me
<s> come i ll go a little further with you i ll say something more
<s> he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made
<s> when that person discloses said mr
<s> jaggers straightening himself you and that person will settle your own affairs
<s> when that person discloses my part in this business will cease and determine
<s> when that person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it
<s> and that s all i have got to say
<s> we looked at one another until i withdrew my eyes and looked thoughtfully at the floor
<s> from this last speech i derived the notion that miss havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for estella that he resented this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to that scheme and would have nothing to do with it
<s> when i raised my eyes again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and was doing so still
<s> if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing left for me to say
<s> he nodded assent and pulled out his thief dreaded watch and asked me where i was going to dine i replied at my own chambers with herbert
<s> as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favour us with his company and he promptly accepted the invitation
<s> but he insisted on walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had his hands to wash
<s> so i said i would go into the outer office and talk to wemmick
<s> the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket a thought had come into my head which had been often there before and it appeared to me that wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought
<s> he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home
<s> he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his hat and great coat ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe key as an athletic exercise after business
<s> mr
<s> wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion
<s> i am very desirous to serve a friend
<s> wemmick tightened his post office and shook his head as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort
<s> this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning
<s> now i want somehow to help him to a beginning
<s> with money down said wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust
<s> with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home with some money down and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations
<s> mr
<s> pip said wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my fingers if you please the names of the various bridges up as high as chelsea reach
<s> let s see there s london one southwark two blackfriars three waterloo four westminster five vauxhall six
<s> he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his safe key on the palm of his hand
<s> there s as many as six you see to choose from
<s> i don t understand you said i
<s> choose your bridge mr
<s> pip returned wemmick and take a walk upon your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch of your bridge and you know the end of it
<s> serve a friend with it and you may know the end of it too but it s a less pleasant and profitable end
<s> i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after saying this
<s> this is very discouraging said i
<s> meant to be so said wemmick
<s> then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation that a man should never
<s> invest portable property in a friend said wemmick
<s> certainly he should not
<s> unless he wants to get rid of the friend and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him
<s> and that said i is your deliberate opinion mr
<s> wemmick
<s> that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office
<s> ah said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole here but would that be your opinion at walworth
<s> mr
<s> pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this office is another
<s> much as the aged is one person and mr
<s> jaggers is another
<s> they must not be confounded together
<s> my walworth sentiments must be taken at walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office
<s> very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at walworth you may depend upon it
<s> mr
<s> pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and personal capacity
<s> we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardian s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp
<s> as he now appeared in his doorway towelling his hands wemmick got on his great coat and stood by to snuff out the candles
<s> we all three went into the street together and from the door step wemmick turned his way and mr
<s> jaggers and i turned ours
<s> i could not help wishing more than once that evening that mr
<s> jaggers had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or a somebody to unbend his brows a little
<s> it was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty first birthday that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it
<s> he was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than wemmick and yet i would a thousand times rather have had wemmick to dinner
<s> and mr
<s> jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because after he was gone herbert said of himself with his eyes fixed on the fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it he felt so dejected and guilty
<s> chapter xxxvii
<s> deeming sunday the best day for taking mr
<s> wemmick s walworth sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the castle
<s> on arriving before the battlements i found the union jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the aged
<s> my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon s walk
<s> he is very regular in his walks is my son
<s> very regular in everything is my son
<s> i nodded at the old gentleman as wemmick himself might have nodded and we went in and sat down by the fireside
<s> you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his chirping way while he warmed his hands at the blaze at his office i expect i nodded
<s> hah i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business sir i nodded hard
<s> yes so they tell me
<s> his business is the law i nodded harder
<s> which makes it more surprising in my son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to the wine coopering
<s> curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of mr
<s> jaggers i roared that name at him
<s> he threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner no to be sure you re right
<s> and to this hour i have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i had made
<s> as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been the wine coopering
<s> by dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning understood
<s> no said the old gentleman the warehousing the warehousing
<s> first over yonder he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he intended to refer me to liverpool and then in the city of london here
<s> however having an infirmity for i am hard of hearing sir
<s> i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment
<s> yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property
<s> but returning to what you said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i say is no to be sure you re right
<s> i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with john upon it
<s> the old man following my eyes cried with great triumph my son s come home and we both went out to the drawbridge
<s> it was worth any money to see wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease
<s> the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until wemmick had come across and had presented me to miss skiffins a lady by whom he was accompanied
<s> miss skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in the post office branch of the service
<s> she might have been some two or three years younger than wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed of portable property
<s> the cut of her dress from the waist upward both before and behind made her figure very like a boy s kite and i might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a little too intensely green
<s> but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow and showed a high regard for the aged
<s> i was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the castle for on our going in and my complimenting wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney and disappeared
<s> presently another click came and another little door tumbled open with miss skiffins on it then miss skiffins shut up and john tumbled open then miss skiffins and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together
<s> on wemmick s return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you know they re both pleasant and useful to the aged
<s> and by george sir it s a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss skiffins and me
<s> and mr
<s> wemmick made them added miss skiffins with his own hands out of his own head
<s> while miss skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property and see how the island looked in wintertime
<s> thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle
<s> having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i had never hinted at it before
<s> i informed wemmick that i was anxious in behalf of herbert pocket and i told him how we had first met and how we had fought
<s> i glanced at herbert s home and at his character and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for those uncertain and unpunctual
<s> i alluded to the advantages i had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might have done better without me and my expectations
<s> keeping miss havisham in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts retaliations or designs
<s> for all these reasons i told wemmick and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him and therefore i sought advice from wemmick s experience and knowledge of men and affairs how i could best try with my resources to help herbert to some present income say of a hundred a year to keep him in good hope and heart and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership
<s> i begged wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help must always be rendered without herbert s knowledge or suspicion and that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise
<s> i wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i can t help confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you but that is your fault in having ever brought me here
<s> wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of start well you know mr
<s> pip i must tell you one thing
<s> this is devilish good of you
<s> say you ll help me to be good then said i
<s> ecod replied wemmick shaking his head that s not my trade
<s> nor is this your trading place said i
<s> you are right he returned
<s> you hit the nail on the head
<s> mr
<s> pip i ll put on my considering cap and i think all you want to do may be done by degrees
<s> skiffins that s her brother is an accountant and agent
<s> i ll look him up and go to work for you
<s> i thank you ten thousand times
<s> on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away
<s> after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into the castle where we found miss skiffins preparing tea
<s> the responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes
<s> it was no nominal meal that we were going to make but a vigorous reality
<s> the aged prepared such a hay stack of buttered toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top bar while miss skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment
<s> the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep
<s> nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of john and miss skiffins which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used to it
<s> i inferred from the methodical nature of miss skiffins s arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night and i rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a piece of portable property that had been given her by wemmick
<s> we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it
<s> the aged especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe just oiled
<s> after a short pause of repose miss skiffins in the absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of her family on sunday afternoons washed up the tea things in a trifling lady like amateur manner that compromised none of us
<s> then she put on her gloves again and we drew round the fire and wemmick said now aged parent tip us the paper
<s> wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud
<s> i won t offer an apology said wemmick for he isn t capable of many pleasures are you aged p
<s> all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself spoken to
<s> only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper said wemmick and he ll be as happy as a king
<s> we are all attention aged one
<s> all right john all right returned the cheerful old man so busy and so pleased that it really was quite charming
<s> the aged s reading reminded me of the classes at mr
<s> wopsle s great aunt s with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole
<s> as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them he required as much watching as a powder mill
<s> but wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on quite unconscious of his many rescues
<s> whenever he looked at us we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he resumed again
<s> as wemmick and miss skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of mr
<s> wemmick s mouth powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round miss skiffins s waist
<s> in course of time i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins but at that moment miss skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her
<s> miss skiffins s composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and if i could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have deemed that miss skiffins performed it mechanically
<s> by and by i noticed wemmick s arm beginning to disappear again and gradually fading out of view
<s> shortly afterwards his mouth began to widen again
<s> after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss skiffins
<s> instantly miss skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid it on the table
<s> taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am justified in stating that during the whole time of the aged s reading wemmick s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by miss skiffins
<s> at last the aged read himself into a light slumber
<s> this was the time for wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a black bottle with a porcelain topped cork representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect
<s> with the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who was soon awake again
<s> miss skiffins mixed and i observed that she and wemmick drank out of one glass
<s> of course i knew better than to offer to see miss skiffins home and under the circumstances i thought i had best go first which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having passed a pleasant evening
<s> before a week was out i received a note from wemmick dated walworth stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would be glad if i could come and see him again upon it
<s> so i went out to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by appointment in the city several times but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near little britain
<s> the upshot was that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping broker not long established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner
<s> between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert was the subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged for sundry other payments some to fall due at certain dates out of my income some contingent on my coming into my property
<s> miss skiffins s brother conducted the negotiation
<s> wemmick pervaded it throughout but never appeared in it
<s> the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it
<s> i never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young merchant s name and of clarriker s having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at last
<s> day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so happy
<s> at length the thing being done and he having that day entered clarriker s house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody
<s> a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my view
<s> but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all the changes it involved i must give one chapter to estella
<s> it is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart
<s> chapter xxxviii
<s> if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost
<s> o the many many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when estella lived there let my body be where it would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that house
<s> the lady with whom estella was placed mrs
<s> brandley by name was a widow with one daughter several years older than estella
<s> the mother looked young and the daughter looked old the mother s complexion was pink and the daughter s was yellow the mother set up for frivolity and the daughter for theology
<s> they were in what is called a good position and visited and were visited by numbers of people
<s> little if any community of feeling subsisted between them and estella but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her and that she was necessary to them
<s> mrs
<s> brandley had been a friend of miss havisham s before the time of her seclusion
<s> in mrs
<s> brandley s house and out of mrs
<s> brandley s house i suffered every kind and degree of torture that estella could cause me
<s> the nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favour conduced to my distraction
<s> she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her
<s> if i had been her secretary steward half brother poor relation if i had been a younger brother of her appointed husband i could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when i was nearest to her
<s> the privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials and while i think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened me
<s> she had admirers without end
<s> no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them without that
<s> i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used often to take her and the brandleys on the water there were picnics fête days plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures through which i pursued her and they were all miseries to me
<s> i never had one hour s happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the four and twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death
<s> throughout this part of our intercourse and it lasted as will presently be seen for what i then thought a long time she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us
<s> there were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me
<s> pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond will you never take warning
<s> of what
<s> of me
<s> warning not to be attracted by you do you mean estella
<s> do i mean if you don t know what i mean you are blind
<s> i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the reason that i always was restrained and this was not the least of my miseries by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss havisham
<s> my dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom
<s> at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you wrote to me to come to you this time
<s> that s true said estella with a cold careless smile that always chilled me
<s> after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on to say
<s> the time has come round when miss havisham wishes to have me for a day at satis
<s> you are to take me there and bring me back if you will
<s> she would rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people
<s> can you take me
<s> can i take you estella
<s> you can then the day after to morrow if you please
<s> you are to pay all charges out of my purse
<s> you hear the condition of your going
<s> and must obey said i
<s> this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others like it miss havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen her handwriting
<s> we went down on the next day but one and we found her in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that there was no change in satis house
<s> she was even more dreadfully fond of estella than she had been when i last saw them together i repeat the word advisedly for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces
<s> she hung upon estella s beauty hung upon her words hung upon her gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared
<s> from estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds
<s> how does she use you pip how does she use you she asked me again with her witch like eagerness even in estella s hearing
<s> but when we sat by her flickering fire at night she was most weird for then keeping estella s hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her by dint of referring back to what estella had told her in her regular letters the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated and as miss havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eyes glaring at me a very spectre
<s> i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened i saw in this that estella was set to wreak miss havisham s revenge on men and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term
<s> i saw in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me
<s> sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief miss havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose
<s> i saw in this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while the prize was reserved for me
<s> i saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian s declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme
<s> in a word i saw in this miss havisham as i had her then and there before my eyes and always had had her before my eyes and i saw in this the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun
<s> the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall
<s> they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed
<s> as i looked round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and thrown back to me
<s> my thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre piece in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor
<s> it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between estella and miss havisham
<s> it was the first time i had ever seen them opposed
<s> we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss havisham still had estella s arm drawn through her own and still clutched estella s hand in hers when estella gradually began to detach herself
<s> she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it
<s> what said miss havisham flashing her eyes upon her are you tired of me
<s> only a little tired of myself replied estella disengaging her arm and moving to the great chimney piece where she stood looking down at the fire
<s> speak the truth you ingrate cried miss havisham passionately striking her stick upon the floor you are tired of me
<s> estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down at the fire
<s> her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other that was almost cruel
<s> you stock and stone exclaimed miss havisham
<s> you cold cold heart
<s> what said estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney piece and only moving her eyes do you reproach me for being cold you
<s> are you not was the fierce retort
<s> you should know said estella
<s> i am what you have made me
<s> take all the praise take all the blame take all the success take all the failure in short take me
<s> o look at her look at her cried miss havisham bitterly look at her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared where i took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs and where i have lavished years of tenderness upon her
<s> 0295m
<s> at least i was no party to the compact said estella for if i could walk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do
<s> but what would you have you have been very good to me and i owe everything to you
<s> what would you have
<s> love replied the other
<s> you have it
<s> i have not said miss havisham
<s> mother by adoption retorted estella never departing from the easy grace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never yielding either to anger or tenderness mother by adoption i have said that i owe everything to you
<s> all i possess is freely yours
<s> all that you have given me is at your command to have again
<s> beyond that i have nothing
<s> and if you ask me to give you what you never gave me my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities
<s> did i never give her love cried miss havisham turning wildly to me
<s> did i never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all times and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me let her call me mad let her call me mad
<s> why should i call you mad returned estella i of all people does any one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as i do does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half as well as i do i who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up into your face when your face was strange and frightened me
<s> soon forgotten moaned miss havisham
<s> times soon forgotten
<s> no not forgotten retorted estella not forgotten but treasured up in my memory
<s> when have you found me false to your teaching when have you found me unmindful of your lessons when have you found me giving admission here she touched her bosom with her hand to anything that you excluded be just to me
<s> so proud so proud moaned miss havisham pushing away her grey hair with both her hands
<s> who taught me to be proud returned estella
<s> who praised me when i learnt my lesson
<s> so hard so hard moaned miss havisham with her former action
<s> who taught me to be hard returned estella
<s> who praised me when i learnt my lesson
<s> but to be proud and hard to me miss havisham quite shrieked as she stretched out her arms
<s> estella estella estella to be proud and hard to me
<s> estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at the fire again
<s> i cannot think said estella raising her eyes after a silence why you should be so unreasonable when i come to see you after a separation
<s> i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes
<s> i have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling
<s> i have never shown any weakness that i can charge myself with
<s> would it be weakness to return my love exclaimed miss havisham
<s> but yes yes she would call it so
<s> i begin to think said estella in a musing way after another moment of calm wonder that i almost understand how this comes about
<s> if you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face if you had done that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and angry
<s> miss havisham with her head in her hands sat making a low moaning and swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer
<s> or said estella which is a nearer case if you had taught her from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had blighted you and would else blight her if you had done this and then for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry
<s> miss havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her face but still made no answer
<s> so said estella i must be taken as i have been made
<s> the success is not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me
<s> miss havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn
<s> i took advantage of the moment i had sought one from the first to leave the room after beseeching estella s attention to her with a movement of my hand
<s> when i left estella was yet standing by the great chimney piece just as she had stood throughout
<s> miss havisham s grey hair was all adrift upon the ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see
<s> it was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about the ruined garden
<s> when i at last took courage to return to the room i found estella sitting at miss havisham s knee taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals
<s> afterwards estella and i played at cards as of yore only we were skilful now and played french games and so the evening wore away and i went to bed
<s> i lay in that separate building across the courtyard
<s> it was the first time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to come near me
<s> a thousand miss havishams haunted me
<s> she was on this side of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the half opened door of the dressing room in the dressing room in the room overhead in the room beneath everywhere
<s> at last when the night was slow to creep on towards two o clock i felt that i absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up
<s> i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind
<s> but i was no sooner in the passage than i extinguished my candle for i saw miss havisham going along it in a ghostly manner making a low cry
<s> i followed her at a distance and saw her go up the staircase
<s> she carried a bare candle in her hand which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room and was a most unearthly object by its light
<s> standing at the bottom of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feast chamber without seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low cry
<s> after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands
<s> during the whole interval whenever i went to the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass above and heard her ceaseless low cry
<s> before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between her and estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and there were four similar occasions to the best of my remembrance
<s> nor did miss havisham s manner towards estella in anywise change except that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics
<s> it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting bentley drummle s name upon it or i would very gladly
<s> on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody s agreeing with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order forasmuch as mr
<s> drummle had not yet toasted a lady which according to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brute s turn to do that day
<s> i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us that might easily be
<s> what was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to estella
<s> estella who said i
<s> never you mind retorted drummle
<s> estella of where said i
<s> you are bound to say of where
<s> which he was as a finch
<s> of richmond gentlemen said drummle putting me out of the question and a peerless beauty
<s> much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot i whispered herbert
<s> i know that lady said herbert across the table when the toast had been honoured
<s> do you said drummle
<s> and so do i i added with a scarlet face
<s> do you said drummle
<s> o lord
<s> this was the only retort except glass or crockery that the heavy creature was capable of making but i became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honourable finch s impudence to come down to that grove we always talked about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of expression down to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing
<s> mr
<s> drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by that whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew where i was to be found
<s> whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood after this was a question on which the finches were divided
<s> the debate upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honourable members told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where they were to be found
<s> however it was decided at last the grove being a court of honour that if mr
<s> drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honour of her acquaintance mr
<s> pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which
<s> next day was appointed for the production lest our honour should take cold from delay and next day drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in estella s hand that she had had the honour of dancing with him several times
<s> this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the idea that i was to be found anywhere
<s> drummle and i then sat snorting at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate
<s> i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me
<s> for i cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that estella should show any favour to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below the average
<s> to the present moment i believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound
<s> no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favoured but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress
<s> it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that drummle had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it
<s> a little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed one another every day
<s> he held on in a dull persistent way and estella held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now scarcely remembering who he was
<s> the spider as mr
<s> jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait however and had the patience of his tribe
<s> added to that he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness which sometimes did him good service almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose
<s> so the spider doggedly watching estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time
<s> at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls at most places then where estella had outshone all other beauties this blundering drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him
<s> i took the next opportunity which was when she was waiting for mrs
<s> blandley to take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go
<s> i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such places
<s> are you tired estella
<s> rather pip
<s> you should be
<s> say rather i should not be for i have my letter to satis house to write before i go to sleep
<s> recounting to night s triumph said i
<s> surely a very poor one estella
<s> what do you mean i didn t know there had been any
<s> estella said i do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is looking over here at us
<s> why should i look at him returned estella with her eyes on me instead
<s> what is there in that fellow in the corner yonder to use your words that i need look at
<s> indeed that is the very question i want to ask you said i
<s> for he has been hovering about you all night
<s> moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied estella with a glance towards him hover about a lighted candle
<s> can the candle help it
<s> no i returned but cannot the estella help it
<s> well said she laughing after a moment perhaps
<s> yes
<s> anything you like
<s> but estella do hear me speak
<s> it makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as drummle
<s> you know he is despised
<s> well said she
<s> you know he is as ungainly within as without
<s> a deficient ill tempered lowering stupid fellow
<s> well said she
<s> you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous roll of addle headed predecessors now don t you
<s> well said she again and each time she said it she opened her lovely eyes the wider
<s> to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it from her and said repeating it with emphasis well then that is why it makes me wretched
<s> now if i could have believed that she favoured drummle with any idea of making me me wretched i should have been in better heart about it but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the question that i could believe nothing of the kind
<s> pip said estella casting her glance over the room don t be foolish about its effect on you
<s> it may have its effect on others and may be meant to have
<s> it s not worth discussing
<s> yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the crowd
<s> i can bear it said estella
<s> oh don t be so proud estella and so inflexible
<s> calls me proud and inflexible in this breath said estella opening her hands
<s> and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor
<s> there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night such as you never give to me
<s> do you want me then said estella turning suddenly with a fixed and serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you
<s> do you deceive and entrap him estella
<s> yes and many others all of them but you
<s> here is mrs
<s> brandley
<s> i ll say no more
<s> and now that i have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered to the event that had impended over me longer yet the event that had begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held estella and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from miss havisham s wasting hands
<s> in the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring
<s> all being made ready with much labour and the hour come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and rushed away and the ceiling fell
<s> so in my case all the work near and afar that tended to the end had been accomplished and in an instant the blow was struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me
<s> chapter xxxix
<s> i was three and twenty years of age
<s> not another word had i heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations and my twenty third birthday was a week gone
<s> we had left barnard s inn more than a year and lived in the temple
<s> our chambers were in garden court down by the river
<s> mr
<s> pocket and i had for some time parted company as to our original relations though we continued on the best terms
<s> notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything which i hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which i held my means i had a taste for reading and read regularly so many hours a day
<s> that matter of herbert s was still progressing and everything with me was as i have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter
<s> business had taken herbert on a journey to marseilles
<s> i was alone and had a dull sense of being alone
<s> dispirited and anxious long hoping that to morrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed i sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend
<s> it was wretched weather stormy and wet stormy and wet and mud mud mud deep in all the streets
<s> day after day a vast heavy veil had been driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east there were an eternity of cloud and wind
<s> so furious had been the gusts that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast of shipwreck and death
<s> violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been the worst of all
<s> alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so exposed to the river
<s> we lived at the top of the last house and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges of cannon or breakings of a sea
<s> when the rain came with it and dashed against the windows i thought raising my eyes to them as they rocked that i might have fancied myself in a storm beaten lighthouse
<s> occasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night and when i set the doors open and looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out and when i shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain i saw that the lamps in the court were blown out and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering and that the coal fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red hot splashes in the rain
<s> i read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book at eleven o clock
<s> as i shut it saint paul s and all the many church clocks in the city some leading some accompanying some following struck that hour
<s> the sound was curiously flawed by the wind and i was listening and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it when i heard a footstep on the stair
<s> what nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister matters not
<s> it was past in a moment and i listened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on
<s> remembering then that the staircase lights were blown out i took up my reading lamp and went out to the stair head
<s> whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet
<s> there is some one down there is there not i called out looking down
<s> yes said a voice from the darkness beneath
<s> what floor do you want
<s> the top
<s> mr
<s> pip
<s> that is my name
<s> there is nothing the matter
<s> nothing the matter returned the voice
<s> and the man came on
<s> i stood with my lamp held out over the stair rail and he came slowly within its light
<s> it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its circle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere instant and then out of it
<s> in the instant i had seen a face that was strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me
<s> moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea
<s> that he had long iron grey hair
<s> that his age was about sixty
<s> that he was a muscular man strong on his legs and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather
<s> as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp included us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was holding out both his hands to me
<s> pray what is your business i asked him
<s> my business he repeated pausing
<s> ah yes
<s> i will explain my business by your leave
<s> do you wish to come in
<s> yes he replied i wish to come in master
<s> i had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face
<s> i resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it
<s> but i took him into the room i had just left and having set the lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to explain himself
<s> he looked about him with the strangest air an air of wondering pleasure as if he had some part in the things he admired and he pulled off a rough outer coat and his hat
<s> then i saw that his head was furrowed and bald and that the long iron grey hair grew only on its sides
<s> but i saw nothing that in the least explained him
<s> on the contrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hands to me
<s> what do you mean said i half suspecting him to be mad
<s> he stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head
<s> it s disapinting to a man he said in a coarse broken voice arter having looked for ard so distant and come so fur but you re not to blame for that neither on us is to blame for that
<s> i ll speak in half a minute
<s> give me half a minute please
<s> he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands
<s> i looked at him attentively then and recoiled a little from him but i did not know him
<s> there s no one nigh said he looking over his shoulder is there
<s> why do you a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night ask that question said i
<s> you re a game one he returned shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection at once most unintelligible and most exasperating i m glad you ve grow d up a game one but don t catch hold of me
<s> you d be sorry arterwards to have done it
<s> i relinquished the intention he had detected for i knew him even yet i could not recall a single feature but i knew him if the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years had scattered all the intervening objects had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels i could not have known my convict more distinctly than i knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire
<s> no need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head no need to hug himself with both his arms and take a shivering turn across the room looking back at me for recognition
<s> i knew him before he gave me one of those aids though a moment before i had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity
<s> he came back to where i stood and again held out both his hands
<s> not knowing what to do for in my astonishment i had lost my self possession i reluctantly gave him my hands
<s> he grasped them heartily raised them to his lips kissed them and still held them
<s> you acted noble my boy said he
<s> noble pip and i have never forgot it
<s> at a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me i laid a hand upon his breast and put him away
<s> stay said i
<s> keep off if you are grateful to me for what i did when i was a little child i hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life
<s> if you have come here to thank me it was not necessary
<s> still however you have found me out there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here and i will not repulse you but surely you must understand that i
<s> my attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me that the words died away on my tongue
<s> you was a saying he observed when we had confronted one another in silence that surely i must understand
<s> what surely must i understand
<s> that i cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago under these different circumstances
<s> i am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself
<s> i am glad to tell you so
<s> i am glad that thinking i deserve to be thanked you have come to thank me
<s> but our ways are different ways none the less
<s> you are wet and you look weary
<s> will you drink something before you go
<s> he had replaced his neckerchief loosely and had stood keenly observant of me biting a long end of it
<s> i think he answered still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me that i will drink i thank you afore i go
<s> there was a tray ready on a side table
<s> i brought it to the table near the fire and asked him what he would have he touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum and water
<s> i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth evidently forgotten made my hand very difficult to master
<s> when at last i put the glass to him i saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears
<s> up to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished him gone
<s> but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and felt a touch of reproach
<s> i hope said i hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table that you will not think i spoke harshly to you just now
<s> i had no intention of doing it and i am sorry for it if i did
<s> i wish you well and happy
<s> as i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and stretched out his hand
<s> i gave him mine and then he drank and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead
<s> how are you living i asked him
<s> i ve been a sheep farmer stock breeder other trades besides away in the new world said he many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this
<s> i hope you have done well
<s> i ve done wonderfully well
<s> there s others went out alonger me as has done well too but no man has done nigh as well as me
<s> i m famous for it
<s> i am glad to hear it
<s> i hope to hear you say so my dear boy
<s> without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken i turned off to a point that had just come into my mind
<s> have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me i inquired since he undertook that trust
<s> never set eyes upon him
<s> i warn t likely to it
<s> he came faithfully and he brought me the two one pound notes
<s> i was a poor boy then as you know and to a poor boy they were a little fortune
<s> but like you i have done well since and you must let me pay them back
<s> you can put them to some other poor boy s use
<s> i took out my purse
<s> he watched me as i laid my purse upon the table and opened it and he watched me as i separated two one pound notes from its contents
<s> they were clean and new and i spread them out and handed them over to him
<s> still watching me he laid them one upon the other folded them long wise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped the ashes into the tray
<s> may i make so bold he said then with a smile that was like a frown and with a frown that was like a smile as ask you how you have done well since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes
<s> how
<s> ah
<s> he emptied his glass got up and stood at the side of the fire with his heavy brown hand on the mantel shelf
<s> he put a foot up to the bars to dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam but he neither looked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me
<s> it was only now that i began to tremble
<s> when my lips had parted and had shaped some words that were without sound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it distinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property
<s> might a mere warmint ask what property said he
<s> i faltered i don t know
<s> might a mere warmint ask whose property said he
<s> i faltered again i don t know
<s> could i make a guess i wonder said the convict at your income since you come of age as to the first figure now
<s> five
<s> with my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action i rose out of my chair and stood with my hand upon the back of it looking wildly at him
<s> concerning a guardian he went on
<s> there ought to have been some guardian or such like whiles you was a minor
<s> some lawyer maybe
<s> as to the first letter of that lawyer s name now
<s> would it be j
<s> all the truth of my position came flashing on me and its disappointments dangers disgraces consequences of all kinds rushed in in such a multitude that i was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath i drew
<s> put it he resumed as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a j and might be jaggers put it as he had come over sea to portsmouth and had landed there and had wanted to come on to you
<s> however you have found me out you says just now
<s> well however did i find you out why i wrote from portsmouth to a person in london for particulars of your address
<s> that person s name why wemmick
<s> i could not have spoken one word though it had been to save my life
<s> i stood with a hand on the chair back and a hand on my breast where i seemed to be suffocating i stood so looking wildly at him until i grasped at the chair when the room began to surge and turn
<s> he caught me drew me to the sofa put me up against the cushions and bent on one knee before me bringing the face that i now well remembered and that i shuddered at very near to mine
<s> yes pip dear boy i ve made a gentleman on you it s me wot has done it i swore that time sure as ever i earned a guinea that guinea should go to you
<s> i swore arterwards sure as ever i spec lated and got rich you should get rich
<s> i lived rough that you should live smooth i worked hard that you should be above work
<s> what odds dear boy do i tell it fur you to feel a obligation not a bit
<s> i tell it fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in got his head so high that he could make a gentleman and pip you re him
<s> the abhorrence in which i held the man the dread i had of him the repugnance with which i shrank from him could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast
<s> look ee here pip
<s> i m your second father
<s> you re my son more to me nor any son
<s> i ve put away money only for you to spend
<s> when i was a hired out shepherd in a solitary hut not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till i half forgot wot men s and women s faces wos like i see yourn
<s> i drops my knife many a time in that hut when i was a eating my dinner or my supper and i says here s the boy again a looking at me whiles i eats and drinks i see you there a many times as plain as ever i see you on them misty marshes
<s> lord strike me dead i says each time and i goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens but wot if i gets liberty and money i ll make that boy a gentleman and i done it
<s> why look at you dear boy look at these here lodgings of yourn fit for a lord a lord ah you shall show money with lords for wagers and beat em
<s> in his heat and triumph and in his knowledge that i had been nearly fainting he did not remark on my reception of all this
<s> it was the one grain of relief i had
<s> look ee here he went on taking my watch out of my pocket and turning towards him a ring on my finger while i recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake a gold un and a beauty that s a gentleman s i hope a diamond all set round with rubies that s a gentleman s i hope look at your linen fine and beautiful look at your clothes better ain t to be got and your books too turning his eyes round the room mounting up on their shelves by hundreds and you read em don t you i see you d been a reading of em when i come in
<s> ha ha ha you shall read em to me dear boy and if they re in foreign languages wot i don t understand i shall be just as proud as if i did
<s> again he took both my hands and put them to his lips while my blood ran cold within me
<s> don t you mind talking pip said he after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead as the click came in his throat which i well remembered and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest you can t do better nor keep quiet dear boy
<s> you ain t looked slowly forward to this as i have you wosn t prepared for this as i wos
<s> but didn t you never think it might be me
<s> o no no no i returned never never
<s> well you see it wos me and single handed
<s> never a soul in it but my own self and mr
<s> jaggers
<s> was there no one else i asked
<s> no said he with a glance of surprise who else should there be and dear boy how good looking you have growed there s bright eyes somewheres eh isn t there bright eyes somewheres wot you love the thoughts on
<s> o estella estella
<s> they shall be yourn dear boy if money can buy em
<s> not that a gentleman like you so well set up as you can t win em off of his own game but money shall back you let me finish wot i was a telling you dear boy
<s> from that there hut and that there hiring out i got money left me by my master which died and had been the same as me and got my liberty and went for myself
<s> in every single thing i went for i went for you
<s> lord strike a blight upon it i says wotever it was i went for if it ain t for him it all prospered wonderful
<s> as i giv you to understand just now i m famous for it
<s> it was the money left me and the gains of the first few year wot i sent home to mr
<s> jaggers all for you when he first come arter you agreeable to my letter
<s> o that he had never come that he had left me at the forge far from contented yet by comparison happy
<s> and then dear boy it was a recompense to me look ee here to know in secret that i was making a gentleman
<s> the blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as i was walking what do i say i says to myself i m making a better gentleman nor ever you ll be when one of em says to another he was a convict a few year ago and is a ignorant common fellow now for all he s lucky what do i say i says to myself if i ain t a gentleman nor yet ain t got no learning i m the owner of such
<s> all on you owns stock and land which on you owns a brought up london gentleman this way i kep myself a going
<s> and this way i held steady afore my mind that i would for certain come one day and see my boy and make myself known to him on his own ground
<s> he laid his hand on my shoulder
<s> i shuddered at the thought that for anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood
<s> it warn t easy pip for me to leave them parts nor yet it warn t safe
<s> but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for i was determined and my mind firm made up
<s> at last i done it
<s> dear boy i done it
<s> i tried to collect my thoughts but i was stunned
<s> throughout i had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him even now i could not separate his voice from those voices though those were loud and his was silent
<s> where will you put me he asked presently
<s> i must be put somewheres dear boy
<s> to sleep said i
<s> yes
<s> and to sleep long and sound he answered for i ve been sea tossed and sea washed months and months
<s> my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent you must have his room
<s> he won t come back to morrow will he
<s> no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost efforts not to morrow
<s> because look ee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is necessary
<s> how do you mean caution
<s> by g it s death
<s> what s death
<s> i was sent for life
<s> it s death to come back
<s> there s been overmuch coming back of late years and i should of a certainty be hanged if took
<s> nothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years had risked his life to come to me and i held it there in my keeping if i had loved him instead of abhorring him if i had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance it could have been no worse
<s> on the contrary it would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart
<s> my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen from without and then to close and make fast the doors
<s> while i did so he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when i saw him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again
<s> it almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his leg
<s> when i had gone into herbert s room and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed he said yes but asked me for some of my gentleman s linen to put on in the morning
<s> i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good night
<s> i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go to bed
<s> for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think and it was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces
<s> miss havisham s intentions towards me all a mere dream estella not designed for me i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first smarts i had
<s> but sharpest and deepest pain of all it was for the convict guilty of i knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out of those rooms where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door that i had deserted joe
<s> i would not have gone back to joe now i would not have gone back to biddy now for any consideration simply i suppose because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration
<s> no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity but i could never never undo what i had done
<s> in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers
<s> twice i could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door
<s> with these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had mysterious warnings of this man s approach
<s> that for weeks gone by i had passed faces in the streets which i had thought like his
<s> that these likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had drawn nearer
<s> that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word and with me
<s> crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man that i had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast
<s> out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a half formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night
<s> this dilated until it filled the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden
<s> he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and lowering in his sleep
<s> but he was asleep and quietly too though he had a pistol lying on the pillow
<s> assured of this i softly removed the key to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down by the fire
<s> gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor
<s> when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness
<s> this is the end of the second stage of pip s expectations
<s> chapter xl
<s> it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought pressing on me when i awoke held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance
<s> the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self evident
<s> it could not be done and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion
<s> true i had no avenger in my service now but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an animated rag bag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration
<s> they both had weak eyes which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny
<s> not to get up a mystery with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country
<s> this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light
<s> not stumbling on the means after all i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern
<s> now in groping my way down the black staircase i fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner
<s> as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly telling him of the incident on the way back
<s> the wind being as fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there
<s> it then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms so lighting my candle at the watchman s and leaving him standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep
<s> all was quiet and assuredly no other man was in those chambers
<s> it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on that night of all nights in the year and i asked the watchman on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out yes he said at different times of the night three
<s> one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in the lane and he had seen them all go home
<s> again the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came upstairs
<s> the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate
<s> besides them three gentlemen that i have named i don t call to mind another since about eleven o clock when a stranger asked for you
<s> my uncle i muttered
<s> yes
<s> you saw him sir
<s> yes
<s> oh yes
<s> likewise the person with him
<s> person with him i repeated
<s> i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman
<s> the person stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this way when he took this way
<s> what sort of person
<s> the watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working person to the best of his belief he had a dust coloured kind of clothes on under a dark coat
<s> the watchman made more light of the matter than i did and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it
<s> when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together
<s> whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart as for instance some diner out or diner at home who had not gone near this watchman s gate might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way still joined they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me
<s> i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning and fell into a doze before it
<s> i seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six
<s> as there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight i dozed again now waking up uneasily with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now making thunder of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start
<s> all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor could i do so yet
<s> i had not the power to attend to it
<s> i was greatly dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way
<s> as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an elephant
<s> when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning all of a leaden hue when i walked from room to room when i sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to appear i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even who i was that made it
<s> at last the old woman and the niece came in the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire
<s> to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly
<s> then i washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream or sleep waking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting for him to come to breakfast
<s> by and by his door opened and he came out
<s> i could not bring myself to bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight
<s> i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the table by what name to call you
<s> i have given out that you are my uncle
<s> that s it dear boy call me uncle
<s> you assumed some name i suppose on board ship
<s> yes dear boy
<s> i took the name of provis
<s> do you mean to keep that name
<s> why yes dear boy it s as good as another unless you d like another
<s> what is your real name i asked him in a whisper
<s> magwitch he answered in the same tone chrisen d abel
<s> what were you brought up to be
<s> a warmint dear boy
<s> he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some profession
<s> when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long ago
<s> yes dear boy
<s> when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had you any one with you
<s> with me no dear boy
<s> but there was some one there
<s> i didn t take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the ways of the place
<s> but i think there was a person too come in alonger me
<s> are you known in london
<s> i hope not said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick
<s> were you known in london once
<s> not over and above dear boy
<s> i was in the provinces mostly
<s> were you tried in london
<s> which time said he with a sharp look
<s> the last time
<s> he nodded
<s> first knowed mr
<s> jaggers that way
<s> jaggers was for me
<s> it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up a knife gave it a flourish and with the words and what i done is worked out and paid for fell to at his breakfast
<s> he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions were uncouth noisy and greedy
<s> some of his teeth had failed him since i saw him eat on the marshes and as he turned his food in his mouth and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog
<s> if i had begun with any appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as i did repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily looking at the cloth
<s> i m a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal but i always was
<s> if it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter trouble
<s> similarly i must have my smoke
<s> when i was first hired out as shepherd t other side the world it s my belief i should ha turned into a molloncolly mad sheep myself if i hadn t a had my smoke
<s> as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the breast of the pea coat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negro head
<s> having filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket were a drawer
<s> then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearth rug with his back to the fire and went through his favourite action of holding out both his hands for mine
<s> and this said he dandling my hands up and down in his as he puffed at his pipe and this is the gentleman what i made the real genuine one it does me good fur to look at you pip
<s> all i stip late is to stand by and look at you dear boy
<s> i released my hands as soon as i could and found that i was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition
<s> what i was chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron grey hair at the sides
<s> i mustn t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets there mustn t be no mud on his boots
<s> my gentleman must have horses pip horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well
<s> shall colonists have their horses and blood uns if you please good lord and not my london gentleman no no
<s> we ll show em another pair of shoes than that pip won t us
<s> he took out of his pocket a great thick pocket book bursting with papers and tossed it on the table
<s> there s something worth spending in that there book dear boy
<s> it s yourn
<s> all i ve got ain t mine it s yourn
<s> don t you be afeerd on it
<s> there s more where that come from
<s> i ve come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman
<s> that ll be my pleasure
<s> my pleasure ull be fur to see him do it
<s> and blast you all he wound up looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap blast you every one from the judge in his wig to the colonist a stirring up the dust i ll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together
<s> stop said i almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike i want to speak to you
<s> i want to know what is to be done
<s> i want to know how you are to be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what projects you have
<s> look ee here pip said he laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner first of all look ee here
<s> i forgot myself half a minute ago
<s> what i said was low that s what it was low
<s> look ee here pip
<s> look over it
<s> i ain t a going to be low
<s> first i resumed half groaning what precautions can be taken against your being recognised and seized
<s> no dear boy he said in the same tone as before that don t go first
<s> lowness goes first
<s> i ain t took so many year to make a gentleman not without knowing what s due to him
<s> look ee here pip
<s> i was low that s what i was low
<s> look over it dear boy
<s> some sense of the grimly ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh as i replied i have looked over it
<s> in heaven s name don t harp upon it
<s> yes but look ee here he persisted
<s> dear boy i ain t come so fur not fur to be low
<s> now go on dear boy
<s> you was a saying
<s> how are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred
<s> well dear boy the danger ain t so great
<s> without i was informed agen the danger ain t so much to signify
<s> there s jaggers and there s wemmick and there s you
<s> who else is there to inform
<s> is there no chance person who might identify you in the street said i
<s> well he returned there ain t many
<s> nor yet i don t intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of a
<s> m
<s> come back from botany bay and years have rolled away and who s to gain by it still look ee here pip
<s> if the danger had been fifty times as great i should ha come to see you mind you just the same
<s> and how long do you remain
<s> how long said he taking his black pipe from his mouth and dropping his jaw as he stared at me
<s> i m not a going back
<s> i ve come for good
<s> where are you to live said i
<s> what is to be done with you where will you be safe
<s> dear boy he returned there s disguising wigs can be bought for money and there s hair powder and spectacles and black clothes shorts and what not
<s> others has done it safe afore and what others has done afore others can do agen
<s> as to the where and how of living dear boy give me your own opinions on it
<s> you take it smoothly now said i but you were very serious last night when you swore it was death
<s> and so i swear it is death said he putting his pipe back in his mouth and death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and it s serious that you should fully understand it to be so
<s> what then when that s once done here i am
<s> to go back now ud be as bad as to stand ground worse
<s> besides pip i m here because i ve meant it by you years and years
<s> as to what i dare i m a old bird now as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and i m not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow
<s> if there s death hid inside of it there is and let him come out and i ll face him and then i ll believe in him and not afore
<s> and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen
<s> once more he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while
<s> it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert returned whom i expected in two or three days
<s> that the secret must be confided to herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with him out of the question was plain to me
<s> but it was by no means so plain to mr
<s> provis i resolved to call him by that name who reserved his consent to herbert s participation until he should have seen him and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy
<s> and even then dear boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of his pocket we ll have him on his oath
<s> to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency would be to state what i never quite established but this i can say that i never knew him put it to any other use
<s> the book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm
<s> on this first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude
<s> as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next discussed with him what dress he should wear
<s> he cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist
<s> it was with considerable difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer s and we arranged that he should cut his hair close and wear a little powder
<s> lastly as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made
<s> it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon
<s> he was to remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account to open the door
<s> there being to my knowledge a respectable lodging house in essex street the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of my windows i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle mr
<s> provis
<s> i then went from shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance
<s> this business transacted i turned my face on my own account to little britain
<s> mr
<s> jaggers was at his desk but seeing me enter got up immediately and stood before his fire
<s> now pip said he be careful
<s> i will sir i returned
<s> for coming along i had thought well of what i was going to say
<s> don t commit yourself said mr
<s> jaggers and don t commit any one
<s> you understand any one
<s> don t tell me anything i don t want to know anything i am not curious
<s> of course i saw that he knew the man was come
<s> i merely want mr
<s> jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have been told is true
<s> i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i may verify it
<s> mr
<s> jaggers nodded
<s> but did you say told or informed he asked me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in a listening way at the floor
<s> told would seem to imply verbal communication
<s> you can t have verbal communication with a man in new south wales you know
<s> i will say informed mr
<s> jaggers
<s> good
<s> i have been informed by a person named abel magwitch that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me
<s> that is the man said mr
<s> jaggers in new south wales
<s> and only he said i
<s> and only he said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions but i always supposed it was miss havisham
<s> as you say pip returned mr
<s> jaggers turning his eyes upon me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all responsible for that
<s> and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart
<s> not a particle of evidence pip said mr
<s> jaggers shaking his head and gathering up his skirts
<s> take nothing on its looks take everything on evidence
<s> there s no better rule
<s> i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for a little while
<s> i have verified my information and there s an end
<s> and magwitch in new south wales having at last disclosed himself said mr
<s> jaggers you will comprehend pip how rigidly throughout my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of fact
<s> there has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact
<s> you are quite aware of that
<s> quite sir
<s> i communicated to magwitch in new south wales when he first wrote to me from new south wales the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact
<s> i also communicated to him another caution
<s> he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here
<s> i cautioned him that i must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law
<s> i gave magwitch that caution said mr
<s> jaggers looking hard at me i wrote it to new south wales
<s> he guided himself by it no doubt
<s> no doubt said i
<s> i have been informed by wemmick pursued mr
<s> jaggers still looking hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of purvis or
<s> or provis i suggested
<s> or provis thank you pip
<s> perhaps it is provis perhaps you know it s provis
<s> yes said i
<s> you know it s provis
<s> a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of provis asking for the particulars of your address on behalf of magwitch
<s> wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by return of post
<s> probably it is through provis that you have received the explanation of magwitch in new south wales
<s> it came through provis i replied
<s> good day pip said mr
<s> jaggers offering his hand glad to have seen you
<s> in writing by post to magwitch in new south wales or in communicating with him through provis have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining
<s> good day pip
<s> we shook hands and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me
<s> i turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open and to force out of their swollen throats o what a man he is
<s> wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me
<s> i went straight back to the temple where i found the terrible provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro head in safety
<s> next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on
<s> whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what he had worn before
<s> to my thinking there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him
<s> the more i dressed him and the better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes
<s> this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but i believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in the very grain of the man
<s> the influences of his solitary hut life were upon him besides and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men and crowning all his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now
<s> in all his ways of sitting and standing and eating and drinking of brooding about in a high shouldered reluctant style of taking out his great horn handled jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy pannikins of chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the most of an allowance and then drying his finger ends on it and then swallowing it in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day there was prisoner felon bondsman plain as plain could be
<s> it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts
<s> but i can compare the effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head
<s> it was abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short
<s> words cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful mystery that he was to me
<s> when he fell asleep of an evening with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy chair and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him
<s> every hour so increased my abhorrence of him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert must soon come back
<s> once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier
<s> i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights with the wind and the rain always rushing by
<s> a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that he would be were no small addition to my horrors
<s> when he was not asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of cards of his own a game that i never saw before or since and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to read to him foreign language dear boy while i complied he not comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the fingers of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency
<s> the imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me
<s> this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year
<s> it lasted about five days
<s> expecting herbert all the time i dared not go out except when i took provis for an airing after dark
<s> at length one evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite worn out for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams i was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase
<s> provis who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand
<s> quiet it s herbert i said and herbert came bursting in with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him
<s> handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again how are you i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth why so i must have been for you have grown quite thin and pale handel my halloa i beg your pardon
<s> he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me by seeing provis
<s> provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something else
<s> herbert my dear friend said i shutting the double doors while herbert stood staring and wondering something very strange has happened
<s> this is a visitor of mine
<s> it s all right dear boy said provis coming forward with his little clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert
<s> take it in your right hand
<s> lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in any way sumever kiss it
<s> do so as he wishes it i said to herbert
<s> so herbert looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and provis immediately shaking hands with him said now you re on your oath you know
<s> and never believe me on mine if pip shan t make a gentleman on you
<s> chapter xli
<s> in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of herbert when he and i and provis sat down before the fire and i recounted the whole of the secret
<s> enough that i saw my own feelings reflected in herbert s face and not least among them my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me
<s> what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story
<s> saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since his return on which point he began to hold forth to herbert the moment my revelation was finished he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune
<s> his boast that he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for himself
<s> and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us and that we must both be very proud of it was a conclusion quite established in his own mind
<s> though look ee here pip s comrade he said to herbert after having discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come back for half a minute i ve been low
<s> i said to pip i knowed as i had been low
<s> but don t you fret yourself on that score
<s> i ain t made pip a gentleman and pip ain t a going to make you a gentleman not fur me not to know what s due to ye both
<s> dear boy and pip s comrade you two may count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on
<s> muzzled i have been since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am at the present time muzzled i ever will be
<s> herbert said certainly but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed
<s> we were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat late
<s> it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and saw him safely in at his own dark door
<s> when it closed upon him i experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of his arrival
<s> never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in bringing him back and i looked about me now
<s> difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements
<s> the few who were passing passed on their several ways and the street was empty when i turned back into the temple
<s> nobody had come out at the gate with us nobody went in at the gate with me
<s> as i crossed by the fountain i saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet and when i stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where i lived before going up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when i ascended it
<s> herbert received me with open arms and i had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend
<s> when he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the question what was to be done
<s> the chair that provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negro head and his jackknife and his pack of cards and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slate i say his chair remaining where it had stood herbert unconsciously took it but next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another
<s> he had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron neither had i occasion to confess my own
<s> we interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable
<s> what said i to herbert when he was safe in another chair what is to be done
<s> my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned to think
<s> so was i herbert when the blow first fell
<s> still something must be done
<s> he is intent upon various new expenses horses and carriages and lavish appearances of all kinds
<s> he must be stopped somehow
<s> you mean that you can t accept
<s> how can i i interposed as herbert paused
<s> think of him look at him
<s> an involuntary shudder passed over both of us
<s> yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert that he is attached to me strongly attached to me
<s> was there ever such a fate
<s> my poor dear handel herbert repeated
<s> then said i after all stopping short here never taking another penny from him think what i owe him already then again i am heavily in debt very heavily for me who have now no expectations and i have been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing
<s> well well well herbert remonstrated
<s> don t say fit for nothing
<s> what am i fit for i know only one thing that i am fit for and that is to go for a soldier
<s> and i might have gone my dear herbert but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection
<s> of course i broke down there and of course herbert beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it
<s> anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering won t do
<s> if you were to renounce this patronage and these favours i suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had
<s> not very strong that hope if you went soldiering besides it s absurd
<s> you would be infinitely better in clarriker s house small as it is
<s> i am working up towards a partnership you know
<s> poor fellow he little suspected with whose money
<s> but there is another question said herbert
<s> this is an ignorant determined man who has long had one fixed idea
<s> more than that he seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce character
<s> i know he is i returned
<s> let me tell you what evidence i have seen of it
<s> and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that encounter with the other convict
<s> see then said herbert think of this he comes here at the peril of his life for the realisation of his fixed idea
<s> in the moment of realisation after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from under his feet destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him
<s> do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment
<s> i have seen it herbert and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night of his arrival
<s> nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken
<s> then you may rely upon it said herbert that there would be great danger of his doing it
<s> that is his power over you as long as he remains in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him
<s> i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my chair but began pacing to and fro
<s> i said to herbert meanwhile that even if provis were recognised and taken in spite of himself i should be wretched as the cause however innocently
<s> yes even though i was so wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than i would ever have come to this
<s> but there was no staving off the question what was to be done
<s> the first and the main thing to be done said herbert is to get him out of england
<s> you will have to go with him and then he may be induced to go
<s> but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back
<s> my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless here than elsewhere if a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his life now
<s> there again said i stopping before herbert with my open hands held out as if they contained the desperation of the case
<s> i know nothing of his life
<s> it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood
<s> herbert got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and fro together studying the carpet
<s> handel said herbert stopping you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him do you
<s> fully
<s> surely you would too if you were in my place
<s> and you feel convinced that you must break with him
<s> herbert can you ask me
<s> and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from throwing it away
<s> then you must get him out of england before you stir a finger to extricate yourself
<s> that done extricate yourself in heaven s name and we ll see it out together dear old boy
<s> it was a comfort to shake hands upon it and walk up and down again with only that done
<s> now herbert said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history
<s> there is but one way that i know of
<s> i must ask him point blank
<s> yes
<s> ask him said herbert when we sit at breakfast in the morning
<s> for he had said on taking leave of herbert that he would come to breakfast with us
<s> with this project formed we went to bed
<s> i had the wildest dreams concerning him and woke unrefreshed i woke too to recover the fear which i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned transport
<s> waking i never lost that fear
<s> he came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat down to his meal
<s> he was full of plans for his gentleman s coming out strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket book which he had left in my possession
<s> he considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to look out at once for a fashionable crib near hyde park in which he could have a shake down
<s> when he had made an end of his breakfast and was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of preface
<s> after you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes when we came up
<s> you remember
<s> remember said he
<s> i think so
<s> we want to know something about that man and about you
<s> it is strange to know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to tell last night
<s> is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more
<s> well he said after consideration
<s> you re on your oath you know pip s comrade
<s> assuredly replied herbert
<s> as to anything i say you know he insisted
<s> the oath applies to all
<s> i understand it to do so
<s> and look ee here wotever i done is worked out and paid for he insisted again
<s> so be it
<s> he took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro head when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative
<s> he put it back again stuck his pipe in a button hole of his coat spread a hand on each knee and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments looked round at us and said what follows
<s> chapter xlii
<s> dear boy and pip s comrade
<s> i am not a going fur to tell you my life like a song or a story book
<s> but to give it you short and handy i ll put it at once into a mouthful of english
<s> in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail
<s> there you ve got it
<s> that s my life pretty much down to such times as i got shipped off arter pip stood my friend
<s> i ve been done everything to pretty well except hanged
<s> i ve been locked up as much as a silver tea kittle
<s> i ve been carted here and carted there and put out of this town and put out of that town and stuck in the stocks and whipped and worried and drove
<s> i ve no more notion where i was born than you have if so much
<s> i first become aware of myself down in essex a thieving turnips for my living
<s> summun had run away from me a man a tinker and he d took the fire with him and left me wery cold
<s> i know d my name to be magwitch chrisen d abel
<s> how did i know it much as i know d the birds names in the hedges to be chaffinch sparrer thrush
<s> i might have thought it was all lies together only as the birds names come out true i supposed mine did
<s> so fur as i could find there warn t a soul that see young abel magwitch with us little on him as in him but wot caught fright at him and either drove him off or took him up
<s> i was took up took up took up to that extent that i reg larly grow d up took up
<s> this is the way it was that when i was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever i see not that i looked in the glass for there warn t many insides of furnished houses known to me i got the name of being hardened
<s> this is a terrible hardened one they says to prison wisitors picking out me
<s> may be said to live in jails this boy
<s> then they looked at me and i looked at them and they measured my head some on em they had better a measured my stomach and others on em giv me tracts what i couldn t read and made me speeches what i couldn t understand
<s> they always went on agen me about the devil
<s> but what the devil was i to do i must put something into my stomach mustn t i howsomever i m a getting low and i know what s due
<s> dear boy and pip s comrade don t you be afeerd of me being low
<s> tramping begging thieving working sometimes when i could though that warn t as often as you may think till you put the question whether you would ha been over ready to give me work yourselves a bit of a poacher a bit of a labourer a bit of a wagoner a bit of a haymaker a bit of a hawker a bit of most things that don t pay and lead to trouble i got to be a man
<s> a deserting soldier in a traveller s rest what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs learnt me to read and a travelling giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write
<s> i warn t locked up as often now as formerly but i wore out my good share of key metal still
<s> at epsom races a matter of over twenty years ago i got acquainted wi a man whose skull i d crack wi this poker like the claw of a lobster if i d got it on this hob
<s> his right name was compeyson and that s the man dear boy what you see me a pounding in the ditch according to what you truly told your comrade arter i was gone last night
<s> he set up fur a gentleman this compeyson and he d been to a public boarding school and had learning
<s> he was a smooth one to talk and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks
<s> he was good looking too
<s> it was the night afore the great race when i found him on the heath in a booth that i know d on
<s> him and some more was a sitting among the tables when i went in and the landlord which had a knowledge of me and was a sporting one called him out and said i think this is a man that might suit you meaning i was
<s> compeyson he looks at me very noticing and i look at him
<s> he has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast pin and a handsome suit of clothes
<s> to judge from appearances you re out of luck says compeyson to me
<s> yes master and i ve never been in it much
<s> i had come out of kingston jail last on a vagrancy committal
<s> not but what it might have been for something else but it warn t
<s> luck changes says compeyson perhaps yours is going to change
<s> i says i hope it may be so
<s> there s room
<s> what can you do says compeyson
<s> eat and drink i says if you ll find the materials
<s> compeyson laughed looked at me again very noticing giv me five shillings and appointed me for next night
<s> same place
<s> i went to compeyson next night same place and compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner
<s> and what was compeyson s business in which we was to go pardners compeyson s business was the swindling handwriting forging stolen bank note passing and such like
<s> all sorts of traps as compeyson could set with his head and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for was compeyson s business
<s> he d no more heart than a iron file he was as cold as death and he had the head of the devil afore mentioned
<s> there was another in with compeyson as was called arthur not as being so chrisen d but as a surname
<s> he was in a decline and was a shadow to look at
<s> him and compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore and they d made a pot of money by it but compeyson betted and gamed and he d have run through the king s taxes
<s> so arthur was a dying and a dying poor and with the horrors on him and compeyson s wife which compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity on him when she could and compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody
<s> i might a took warning by arthur but i didn t and i won t pretend i was partick ler for where ud be the good on it dear boy and comrade so i begun wi compeyson and a poor tool i was in his hands
<s> arthur lived at the top of compeyson s house over nigh brentford it was and compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging in case he should ever get better to work it out
<s> but arthur soon settled the account
<s> the second or third time as ever i see him he come a tearing down into compeyson s parlour late at night in only a flannel gown with his hair all in a sweat and he says to compeyson s wife sally she really is upstairs alonger me now and i can t get rid of her
<s> she s all in white he says wi white flowers in her hair and she s awful mad and she s got a shroud hanging over her arm and she says she ll put it on me at five in the morning
<s> says compeyson why you fool don t you know she s got a living body and how should she be up there without coming through the door or in at the window and up the stairs
<s> i don t know how she s there says arthur shivering dreadful with the horrors but she s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed awful mad
<s> and over where her heart s broke you broke it there s drops of blood
<s> compeyson spoke hardy but he was always a coward
<s> go up alonger this drivelling sick man he says to his wife and magwitch lend her a hand will you but he never come nigh himself
<s> compeyson s wife and me took him up to bed agen and he raved most dreadful
<s> why look at her he cries out
<s> she s a shaking the shroud at me don t you see her look at her eyes ain t it awful to see her so mad next he cries she ll put it on me and then i m done for take it away from her take it away and then he catched hold of us and kep on a talking to her and answering of her till i half believed i see her myself
<s> compeyson s wife being used to him giv him some liquor to get the horrors off and by and by he quieted
<s> o she s gone has her keeper been for her he says
<s> yes says compeyson s wife
<s> did you tell him to lock her and bar her in yes
<s> and to take that ugly thing away from her yes yes all right
<s> you re a good creetur he says don t leave me whatever you do and thank you
<s> he rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and then he starts up with a scream and screams out here she is she s got the shroud again
<s> she s unfolding it
<s> she s coming out of the corner
<s> she s coming to the bed
<s> hold me both on you one of each side don t let her touch me with it
<s> hah she missed me that time
<s> don t let her throw it over my shoulders
<s> don t let her lift me up to get it round me
<s> she s lifting me up
<s> keep me down then he lifted himself up hard and was dead
<s> compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides
<s> him and me was soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own book this here little black book dear boy what i swore your comrade on
<s> not to go into the things that compeyson planned and i done which ud take a week i ll simply say to you dear boy and pip s comrade that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave
<s> i was always in debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a getting into danger
<s> he was younger than me but he d got craft and he d got learning and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy
<s> my missis as i had the hard time wi stop though i ain t brought her in
<s> he looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire and spread his hands broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them on again
<s> there ain t no need to go into it he said looking round once more
<s> the time wi compeyson was a most as hard a time as ever i had that said all s said
<s> did i tell you as i was tried alone for misdemeanor while with compeyson
<s> i answered no
<s> well he said i was and got convicted
<s> as to took up on suspicion that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted but evidence was wanting
<s> at last me and compeyson was both committed for felony on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation and there was other charges behind
<s> compeyson says to me separate defences no communication and that was all
<s> and i was so miserable poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on my back afore i could get jaggers
<s> when we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman compeyson looked wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket handkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked
<s> when the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him
<s> when the evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had come for ard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit
<s> but when the defence come on then i see the plan plainer for says the counsellor for compeyson my lord and gentlemen here you has afore you side by side two persons as your eyes can separate wide one the younger well brought up who will be spoke to as such one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to as such one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here transactions and only suspected t other the elder always seen in em and always wi his guilt brought home
<s> can you doubt if there is but one in it which is the one and if there is two in it which is much the worst one and such like
<s> and when it come to character warn t it compeyson as had been to the school and warn t it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that and warn t it him as had been know d by witnesses in such clubs and societies and nowt to his disadvantage and warn t it me as had been tried afore and as had been know d up hill and down dale in bridewells and lock ups and when it come to speech making warn t it compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket handkercher ah and wi verses in his speech too and warn t it me as could only say gentlemen this man at my side is a most precious rascal and when the verdict come warn t it compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company and giving up all the information he could agen me and warn t it me as got never a word but guilty and when i says to compeyson once out of this court i ll smash that face of yourn ain t it compeyson as prays the judge to be protected and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us and when we re sentenced ain t it him as gets seven year and me fourteen and ain t it him as the judge is sorry for because he might a done so well and ain t it me as the judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion likely to come to worse
<s> he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked it took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching out his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner i ain t a going to be low dear boy
<s> he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands before he could go on
<s> 0335m
<s> i had said to compeyson that i d smash that face of his and i swore lord smash mine to do it
<s> we was in the same prison ship but i couldn t get at him for long though i tried
<s> at last i come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him when i was seen and seized
<s> the black hole of that ship warn t a strong one to a judge of black holes that could swim and dive
<s> i escaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there envying them as was in em and all over when i first see my boy
<s> he regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again though i had felt great pity for him
<s> by my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them marshes too
<s> upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to get quit of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore
<s> i hunted him down
<s> i smashed his face
<s> and now says i as the worst thing i can do caring nothing for myself i ll drag you back
<s> and i d have swum off towing him by the hair if it had come to that and i d a got him aboard without the soldiers
<s> of course he d much the best of it to the last his character was so good
<s> he had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions and his punishment was light
<s> i was put in irons brought to trial again and sent for life
<s> i didn t stop for life dear boy and pip s comrade being here
<s> he wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his button hole and slowly filled it and began to smoke
<s> is he dead i asked after a silence
<s> is who dead dear boy
<s> compeyson
<s> he hopes i am if he s alive you may be sure with a fierce look
<s> i never heerd no more of him
<s> herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book
<s> he softly pushed the book over to me as provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire and i read in it
<s> young havisham s name was arthur
<s> compeyson is the man who professed to be miss havisham s lover
<s> i shut the book and nodded slightly to herbert and put the book by but we neither of us said anything and both looked at provis as he stood smoking by the fire
<s> chapter xliii
<s> why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from provis might be traced to estella why should i loiter on my road to compare the state of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach office with the state of mind in which i now reflected on the abyss between estella in her pride and beauty and the returned transport whom i harboured the road would be none the smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not be helped nor i extenuated
<s> a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there
<s> if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could hardly doubt the consequence
<s> that compeyson stood in mortal fear of him neither of the two could know much better than i and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined
<s> never had i breathed and never would i breathe or so i resolved a word of estella to provis
<s> but i said to herbert that before i could go abroad i must see both estella and miss havisham
<s> this was when we were left alone on the night of the day when provis told us his story
<s> i resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went
<s> on my presenting myself at mrs
<s> brandley s estella s maid was called to tell that estella had gone into the country
<s> where to satis house as usual
<s> not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without me when was she coming back there was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while
<s> i could make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture
<s> another night consultation with herbert after provis was gone home i always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came back from miss havisham s
<s> in the mean time herbert and i were to consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose an expedition
<s> we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he would consent
<s> we agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of
<s> next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise to go down to joe but i was capable of almost any meanness towards joe or his name
<s> provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and herbert was to take the charge of him that i had taken
<s> i was to be absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun
<s> it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to herbert also that he might be best got away across the water on that pretence as to make purchases or the like
<s> having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss havisham s i set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist like a beggar
<s> when we drove up to the blue boar after a drizzly ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand to look at the coach but bentley drummle
<s> as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him
<s> it was a very lame pretence on both sides the lamer because we both went into the coffee room where he had just finished his breakfast and where i ordered mine
<s> it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very well knew why he had come there
<s> pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire
<s> by degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire
<s> and i got up determined to have my share of it
<s> i had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to stir the fire but still pretended not to know him
<s> is this a cut said mr
<s> drummle
<s> oh said i poker in hand it s you is it how do you do i was wondering who it was who kept the fire off
<s> with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side by side with mr
<s> drummle my shoulders squared and my back to the fire
<s> you have just come down said mr
<s> drummle edging me a little away with his shoulder
<s> yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder
<s> beastly place said drummle
<s> your part of the country i think
<s> yes i assented
<s> i am told it s very like your shropshire
<s> not in the least like it said drummle
<s> here mr
<s> drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then mr
<s> drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his
<s> have you been here long i asked determined not to yield an inch of the fire
<s> long enough to be tired of it returned drummle pretending to yawn but equally determined
<s> do you stay here long
<s> can t say answered mr
<s> drummle
<s> do you
<s> can t say said i
<s> i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if mr
<s> drummle s shoulder had claimed another hair s breadth of room i should have jerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim mr
<s> drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box
<s> he whistled a little
<s> so did i
<s> large tract of marshes about here i believe said drummle
<s> yes
<s> what of that said i
<s> mr
<s> drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh and laughed
<s> are you amused mr
<s> drummle
<s> no said he not particularly
<s> i am going out for a ride in the saddle
<s> i mean to explore those marshes for amusement
<s> out of the way villages there they tell me
<s> curious little public houses and smithies and that
<s> waiter
<s> yes sir
<s> is that horse of mine ready
<s> brought round to the door sir
<s> i say
<s> look here you sir
<s> the lady won t ride to day the weather won t do
<s> very good sir
<s> and i don t dine because i m going to dine at the lady s
<s> very good sir
<s> then drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his great jowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arms as the robber in the story book is said to have taken the old lady and seat him on the fire
<s> one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief came neither of us could relinquish the fire
<s> there we stood well squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our hands behind us not budging an inch
<s> the horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table drummle s was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both stood our ground
<s> have you been to the grove since said drummle
<s> no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was there
<s> was that when we had a difference of opinion
<s> yes i replied very shortly
<s> come come they let you off easily enough sneered drummle
<s> you shouldn t have lost your temper
<s> mr
<s> drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that subject
<s> when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that occasion i don t throw glasses
<s> i do said drummle
<s> after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of smouldering ferocity i said
<s> mr
<s> drummle i did not seek this conversation and i don t think it an agreeable one
<s> i am sure it s not said he superciliously over his shoulder i don t think anything about it
<s> and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future
<s> quite my opinion said drummle and what i should have suggested myself or done more likely without suggesting
<s> but don t lose your temper
<s> haven t you lost enough without that
<s> what do you mean sir
<s> waiter said drummle by way of answering me
<s> the waiter reappeared
<s> look here you sir
<s> you quite understand that the young lady don t ride to day and that i dine at the young lady s
<s> quite so sir
<s> when the waiter had felt my fast cooling teapot with the palm of his hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out drummle careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring
<s> choking and boiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without introducing estella s name which i could not endure to hear him utter and therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were no one present and forced myself to silence
<s> how long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but for the incursion of three thriving farmers laid on by the waiter i think who came into the coffee room unbuttoning their great coats and rubbing their hands and before whom as they charged at the fire we were obliged to give way
<s> i saw him through the window seizing his horse s mane and mounting in his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away
<s> i thought he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth which he had forgotten
<s> a man in a dust coloured dress appeared with what was wanted i could not have said from where whether from the inn yard or the street or where not and as drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his head towards the coffee room windows the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of orlick
<s> too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered never to have seen
<s> chapter xliv
<s> in the room where the dressing table stood and where the wax candles burnt on the wall i found miss havisham and estella miss havisham seated on a settee near the fire and estella on a cushion at her feet
<s> estella was knitting and miss havisham was looking on
<s> they both raised their eyes as i went in and both saw an alteration in me
<s> i derived that from the look they interchanged
<s> and what wind said miss havisham blows you here pip
<s> though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused
<s> estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me and then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her fingers as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i had discovered my real benefactor
<s> miss havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to estella and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed
<s> miss havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down i took the chair by the dressing table which i had often seen her occupy
<s> with all that ruin at my feet and about me it seemed a natural place for me that day
<s> what i had to say to estella miss havisham i will say before you presently in a few moments
<s> it will not surprise you it will not displease you
<s> i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be
<s> miss havisham continued to look steadily at me
<s> i could see in the action of estella s fingers as they worked that she attended to what i said but she did not look up
<s> i have found out who my patron is
<s> it is not a fortunate discovery and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune anything
<s> there are reasons why i must say no more of that
<s> it is not my secret but another s
<s> as i was silent for a while looking at estella and considering how to go on miss havisham repeated it is not your secret but another s
<s> well
<s> when you first caused me to be brought here miss havisham when i belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left i suppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have come as a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid for it
<s> ay pip replied miss havisham steadily nodding her head you did
<s> and that mr
<s> jaggers
<s> mr
<s> jaggers said miss havisham taking me up in a firm tone had nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it
<s> his being my lawyer and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence
<s> he holds the same relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise
<s> be that as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one
<s> any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far
<s> but when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least you led me on said i
<s> yes she returned again nodding steadily i let you go on
<s> was that kind
<s> who am i cried miss havisham striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that estella glanced up at her in surprise who am i for god s sake that i should be kind
<s> it was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it
<s> i told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst
<s> well well well she said
<s> what else
<s> i was liberally paid for my old attendance here i said to soothe her in being apprenticed and i have asked these questions only for my own information
<s> what follows has another and i hope more disinterested purpose
<s> in humouring my mistake miss havisham you punished practised on perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention without offence your self seeking relations
<s> i did
<s> why they would have it so so would you
<s> what has been my history that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so you made your own snares
<s> i never made them
<s> waiting until she was quiet again for this too flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way i went on
<s> i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss havisham and have been constantly among them since i went to london
<s> i know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself
<s> and i should be false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you deeply wrong both mr
<s> matthew pocket and his son herbert if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of anything designing or mean
<s> they are your friends said miss havisham
<s> they made themselves my friends said i when they supposed me to have superseded them and when sarah pocket miss georgiana and mistress camilla were not my friends i think
<s> this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do them good with her
<s> she looked at me keenly for a little while and then said quietly
<s> what do you want for them
<s> only said i that you would not confound them with the others
<s> they may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same nature
<s> still looking at me keenly miss havisham repeated
<s> what do you want for them
<s> i am not so cunning you see i said in answer conscious that i reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired that i do want something
<s> miss havisham if you would spare the money to do my friend herbert a lasting service in life but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you how
<s> why must it be done without his knowledge she asked settling her hands upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively
<s> because said i i began the service myself more than two years ago without his knowledge and i don t want to be betrayed
<s> why i fail in my ability to finish it i cannot explain
<s> it is a part of the secret which is another person s and not mine
<s> she gradually withdrew her eyes from me and turned them on the fire
<s> after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me again at first vacantly then with a gradually concentrating attention
<s> all this time estella knitted on
<s> when miss havisham had fixed her attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue
<s> what else
<s> estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my trembling voice you know i love you
<s> you know that i have loved you long and dearly
<s> she raised her eyes to my face on being thus addressed and her fingers plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance
<s> i saw that miss havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me
<s> i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake
<s> it induced me to hope that miss havisham meant us for one another
<s> while i thought you could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it
<s> but i must say it now
<s> preserving her unmoved countenance and with her fingers still going estella shook her head
<s> i know said i in answer to that action i know
<s> i have no hope that i shall ever call you mine estella
<s> i am ignorant what may become of me very soon how poor i may be or where i may go
<s> still i love you
<s> i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house
<s> looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy she shook her head again
<s> it would have been cruel in miss havisham horribly cruel to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did
<s> but i think she did not
<s> i think that in the endurance of her own trial she forgot mine estella
<s> i saw miss havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she sat looking by turns at estella and at me
<s> it seems said estella very calmly that there are sentiments fancies i don t know how to call them which i am not able to comprehend
<s> when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form of words but nothing more
<s> you address nothing in my breast you touch nothing there
<s> i don t care for what you say at all
<s> i have tried to warn you of this now have i not
<s> i said in a miserable manner yes
<s> yes
<s> but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it
<s> now did you not think so
<s> i thought and hoped you could not mean it
<s> you so young untried and beautiful estella surely it is not in nature
<s> it is in my nature she returned
<s> and then she added with a stress upon the words it is in the nature formed within me
<s> i make a great difference between you and all other people when i say so much
<s> i can do no more
<s> is it not true said i that bentley drummle is in town here and pursuing you
<s> it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt
<s> that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with you this very day
<s> she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied quite true
<s> you cannot love him estella
<s> her fingers stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily what have i told you do you still think in spite of it that i do not mean what i say
<s> you would never marry him estella
<s> she looked towards miss havisham and considered for a moment with her work in her hands
<s> then she said why not tell you the truth i am going to be married to him
<s> i dropped my face into my hands but was able to control myself better than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words
<s> when i raised my face again there was such a ghastly look upon miss havisham s that it impressed me even in my passionate hurry and grief
<s> estella dearest estella do not let miss havisham lead you into this fatal step
<s> put me aside for ever you have done so i well know but bestow yourself on some worthier person than drummle
<s> miss havisham gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you and to the few who truly love you
<s> among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly though he has not loved you as long as i
<s> take him and i can bear it better for your sake
<s> my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind
<s> i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to him
<s> the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be married soon
<s> why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption it is my own act
<s> your own act estella to fling yourself away upon a brute
<s> on whom should i fling myself away she retorted with a smile
<s> should i fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if people do feel such things that i took nothing to him there it is done
<s> i shall do well enough and so will my husband
<s> as to leading me into what you call this fatal step miss havisham would have had me wait and not marry yet but i am tired of the life i have led which has very few charms for me and i am willing enough to change it
<s> say no more
<s> we shall never understand each other
<s> such a mean brute such a stupid brute i urged in despair
<s> don t be afraid of my being a blessing to him said estella i shall not be that
<s> come here is my hand
<s> do we part on this you visionary boy or man
<s> o estella i answered as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand do what i would to restrain them even if i remained in england and could hold my head up with the rest how could i see you drummle s wife
<s> nonsense she returned nonsense
<s> this will pass in no time
<s> never estella
<s> you will get me out of your thoughts in a week
<s> out of my thoughts you are part of my existence part of myself
<s> you have been in every line i have ever read since i first came here the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then
<s> you have been in every prospect i have ever seen since on the river on the sails of the ships on the marshes in the clouds in the light in the darkness in the wind in the woods in the sea in the streets
<s> you have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with
<s> the stones of which the strongest london buildings are made are not more real or more impossible to be displaced by your hands than your presence and influence have been to me there and everywhere and will be
<s> estella to the last hour of my life you cannot choose but remain part of my character part of the little good in me part of the evil
<s> but in this separation i associate you only with the good and i will faithfully hold you to that always for you must have done me far more good than harm let me feel now what sharp distress i may
<s> o god bless you god forgive you
<s> in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken words out of myself i don t know
<s> the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an inward wound and gushed out
<s> i held her hand to my lips some lingering moments and so i left her
<s> but ever afterwards i remembered and soon afterwards with stronger reason that while estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss havisham her hand still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse
<s> all done all gone so much was done and gone that when i went out at the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when i went in
<s> for a while i hid myself among some lanes and by paths and then struck off to walk all the way to london
<s> for i had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and see drummle there that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out
<s> it was past midnight when i crossed london bridge
<s> pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was close by the river side through whitefriars
<s> i was not expected till to morrow but i had my keys and if herbert were gone to bed could get to bed myself without disturbing him
<s> as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it ill that the night porter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in
<s> to help his memory i mentioned my name
<s> i was not quite sure sir but i thought so
<s> here s a note sir
<s> the messenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my lantern
<s> 0348m
<s> much surprised by the request i took the note
<s> it was directed to philip pip esquire and on the top of the superscription were the words please read this here
<s> i opened it the watchman holding up his light and read inside in wemmick s writing
<s> don t go home
<s> chapter xlv
<s> turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the hummums in covent garden
<s> in those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list
<s> it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a despotic monster of a four post bedstead in it straddling over the whole place putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little washing stand in quite a divinely righteous manner
<s> as i had asked for a night light the chamberlain had brought me in before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days an object like the ghost of a walking cane which instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide awake pattern on the walls
<s> when i had got into bed and lay there footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own eyes than i could close the eyes of this foolish argus
<s> and thus in the gloom and death of the night we stared at one another
<s> what a doleful night how anxious how dismal how long there was an inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as i looked up into the corners of the tester over my head i thought what a number of blue bottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying by for next summer
<s> this led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my face a disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back
<s> when i had lain awake a little while those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible
<s> the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little washing stand ticked and one guitar string played occasionally in the chest of drawers
<s> at about the same time the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw written don t go home
<s> whatever night fancies and night noises crowded on me they never warded off this don t go home
<s> it plaited itself into whatever i thought of as a bodily pain would have done
<s> not long before i had read in the newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been found in the morning weltering in blood
<s> it came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing
<s> but all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home and when i should go home and whether provis was safe at home were questions occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme
<s> even when i thought of estella and how we had parted that day forever and when i recalled all the circumstances of our parting and all her looks and tones and the action of her fingers while she knitted even then i was pursuing here and there and everywhere the caution don t go home
<s> when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate
<s> imperative mood present tense do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do not ye or you go home let not them go home
<s> then potentially i may not and i cannot go home and i might not could not would not and should not go home until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again
<s> i had left directions that i was to be called at seven for it was plain that i must see wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be taken
<s> it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed
<s> the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o clock
<s> the little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company and so came without announcement into the presence of wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the aged
<s> an open door afforded a perspective view of the aged in bed
<s> halloa mr
<s> pip said wemmick
<s> you did come home then
<s> yes i returned but i didn t go home
<s> that s all right said he rubbing his hands
<s> i left a note for you at each of the temple gates on the chance
<s> which gate did you come to
<s> i told him
<s> i ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes said wemmick it s a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it because you don t know when it may be put in
<s> i m going to take a liberty with you
<s> would you mind toasting this sausage for the aged p
<s> i said i should be delighted to do it
<s> then you can go about your work mary anne said wemmick to the little servant which leaves us to ourselves don t you see mr
<s> pip he added winking as she disappeared
<s> i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the aged s sausage and he buttered the crumb of the aged s roll
<s> now mr
<s> pip you know said wemmick you and i understand one another
<s> we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to day
<s> official sentiments are one thing
<s> we are extra official
<s> i cordially assented
<s> i was so very nervous that i had already lighted the aged s sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out
<s> i accidentally heard yesterday morning said wemmick being in a certain place where i once took you even between you and me it s as well not to mention names when avoidable
<s> much better not said i
<s> i understand you
<s> i heard there by chance yesterday morning said wemmick that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not unpossessed of portable property i don t know who it may really be we won t name this person
<s> not necessary said i
<s> had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations and not quite irrespective of the government expense
<s> in watching his face i made quite a firework of the aged s sausage and greatly discomposed both my own attention and wemmick s for which i apologised
<s> by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of thereabouts
<s> from which said wemmick conjectures had been raised and theories formed
<s> i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court temple had been watched and might be watched again
<s> by whom said i
<s> i wouldn t go into that said wemmick evasively it might clash with official responsibilities
<s> i heard it as i have in my time heard other curious things in the same place
<s> i don t tell it you on information received
<s> i heard it
<s> he took the toasting fork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth the aged s breakfast neatly on a little tray
<s> previous to placing it before him he went into the aged s room with a clean white cloth and tied the same under the old gentleman s chin and propped him up and put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air
<s> then he placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right ain t you aged p
<s> to which the cheerful aged replied all right john my boy all right as there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings
<s> this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to suspect i said to wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted is it
<s> wemmick looked very serious
<s> i couldn t undertake to say that of my own knowledge
<s> i mean i couldn t undertake to say it was at first
<s> but it either is or it will be or it s in great danger of being
<s> as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him
<s> but i told him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he deemed right and sure that his course would be right
<s> he paused in his breakfast and crossing his arms and pinching his shirt sleeves his notion of in door comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me once to put my question
<s> you have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is compeyson
<s> he answered with one other nod
<s> is he living
<s> one other nod
<s> is he in london
<s> he gave me one other nod compressed the post office exceedingly gave me one last nod and went on with his breakfast
<s> now said wemmick questioning being over which he emphasised and repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i heard
<s> i went to garden court to find you not finding you i went to clarriker s to find mr
<s> herbert
<s> and him you found said i with great anxiety
<s> and him i found
<s> without mentioning any names or going into any details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody tom jack or richard being about the chambers or about the immediate neighbourhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way while you were out of the way
<s> he would be greatly puzzled what to do
<s> he was puzzled what to do not the less because i gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out of the way at present
<s> mr
<s> pip i ll tell you something
<s> under existing circumstances there is no place like a great city when you are once in it
<s> don t break cover too soon
<s> lie close
<s> wait till things slacken before you try the open even for foreign air
<s> i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert had done
<s> mr
<s> herbert said wemmick after being all of a heap for half an hour struck out a plan
<s> he mentioned to me as a secret that he is courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden pa
<s> which pa having been in the purser line of life lies a bed in a bow window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river
<s> you are acquainted with the young lady most probably
<s> not personally said i
<s> the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did herbert no good and that when herbert had first proposed to present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth that herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made her acquaintance
<s> when i had begun to advance herbert s prospects by stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews and thus although i was assured that i had risen in clara s esteem and although the young lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by herbert i had never seen her
<s> however i did not trouble wemmick with these particulars
<s> the house with the bow window said wemmick being by the river side down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let mr
<s> herbert put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary tenement for tom jack or richard now i thought very well of it for three reasons i ll give you
<s> that is to say firstly
<s> it s altogether out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small
<s> secondly
<s> without going near it yourself you could always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through mr
<s> herbert
<s> thirdly
<s> after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packet boat there he is ready
<s> much comforted by these considerations i thanked wemmick again and again and begged him to proceed
<s> well sir mr
<s> herbert threw himself into the business with a will and by nine o clock last night he housed tom jack or richard whichever it may be you and i don t want to know quite successfully
<s> at the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it
<s> now another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged
<s> this diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason i recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go home
<s> it brings in more confusion and you want confusion
<s> wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and began to get his coat on
<s> and now mr
<s> pip said he with his hands still in the sleeves i have probably done the most i can do but if i can ever do more from a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal capacity i shall be glad to do it
<s> here s the address
<s> there can be no harm in your going here to night and seeing for yourself that all is well with tom jack or richard before you go home which is another reason for your not going home last night
<s> but after you have gone home don t go back here
<s> you are very welcome i am sure mr
<s> pip his hands were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them and let me finally impress one important point upon you
<s> he laid his hands upon my shoulders and added in a solemn whisper avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property
<s> you don t know what may happen to him
<s> don t let anything happen to the portable property
<s> quite despairing of making my mind clear to wemmick on this point i forbore to try
<s> time s up said wemmick and i must be off
<s> if you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark that s what i should advise
<s> you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the aged he ll be up presently and a little bit of you remember the pig
<s> of course said i
<s> well and a little bit of him
<s> that sausage you toasted was his and he was in all respects a first rater
<s> do try him if it is only for old acquaintance sake
<s> good bye aged parent in a cheery shout
<s> all right john all right my boy piped the old man from within
<s> i soon fell asleep before wemmick s fire and the aged and i enjoyed one another s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day
<s> we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it drowsily
<s> when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for toast and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall that miss skiffins was expected
<s> chapter xlvi
<s> eight o clock had struck before i got into the air that was scented not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the long shore boat builders and mast oar and block makers
<s> all that water side region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to me and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to find
<s> it was called mill pond bank chinks s basin and i had no other guide to chinks s basin than the old green copper rope walk
<s> it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of ship builders and ship breakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground though for years off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber how many rope walks that were not the old green copper
<s> after several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank
<s> it was a fresh kind of place all circumstances considered where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round and there were two or three trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there was the old green copper rope walk whose long and narrow vista i could trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the ground that looked like superannuated haymaking rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth
<s> selecting from the few queer houses upon mill pond bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow window not bay window which is another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there mrs
<s> whimple
<s> that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded
<s> she was immediately deposed however by herbert who silently led me into the parlour and shut the door
<s> it was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at the corner cupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the chimney piece and the coloured engravings on the wall representing the death of captain cook a ship launch and his majesty king george the third in a state coachman s wig leather breeches and top boots on the terrace at windsor
<s> all is well handel said herbert and he is quite satisfied though eager to see you
<s> my dear girl is with her father and if you ll wait till she comes down i ll make you known to her and then we ll go upstairs
<s> that s her father
<s> i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance
<s> i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert smiling but i have never seen him
<s> don t you smell rum he is always at it
<s> at rum said i
<s> yes returned herbert and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout
<s> he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room and serving them out
<s> he keeps them on shelves over his head and will weigh them all
<s> his room must be like a chandler s shop
<s> while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and then died away
<s> what else can be the consequence said herbert in explanation if he will cut the cheese a man with the gout in his right hand and everywhere else can t expect to get through a double gloucester without hurting himself
<s> he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious roar
<s> to have provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to mrs
<s> whimple said herbert for of course people in general won t stand that noise
<s> a curious place handel isn t it
<s> it was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean
<s> mrs
<s> whimple said herbert when i told him so is the best of housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without her motherly help
<s> for clara has no mother of her own handel and no relation in the world but old gruffandgrim
<s> surely that s not his name herbert
<s> no no said herbert that s my name for him
<s> his name is mr
<s> barley
<s> but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family
<s> herbert had told me on former occasions and now reminded me that he first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the motherly mrs
<s> whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion ever since
<s> it was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than gout rum and purser s stores
<s> as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barley s sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door opened and a very pretty slight dark eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand whom herbert tenderly relieved of the basket and presented blushing as clara
<s> she really was a most charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service
<s> look here said herbert showing me the basket with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little here s poor clara s supper served out every night
<s> here s her allowance of bread and here s her slice of cheese and here s her rum which i drink
<s> this is mr
<s> barley s breakfast for to morrow served out to be cooked
<s> two mutton chops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper
<s> it s stewed up together and taken hot and it s a nice thing for the gout i should think
<s> there was something so natural and winning in clara s resigned way of looking at these stores in detail as herbert pointed them out and something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to herbert s embracing arm and something so gentle in her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinks s basin and the old green copper rope walk with old barley growling in the beam that i would not have undone the engagement between her and herbert for all the money in the pocket book i had never opened
<s> i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us
<s> upon this clara said to herbert papa wants me darling and ran away
<s> there is an unconscionable old shark for you said herbert
<s> what do you suppose he wants now handel
<s> i don t know said i
<s> something to drink
<s> that s it cried herbert as if i had made a guess of extraordinary merit
<s> he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table
<s> wait a moment and you ll hear clara lift him up to take some
<s> there he goes another roar with a prolonged shake at the end
<s> now said herbert as it was succeeded by silence he s drinking
<s> now said herbert as the growl resounded in the beam once more he s down again on his back
<s> clara returned soon afterwards and herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge
<s> as we passed mr
<s> barley s door he was heard hoarsely muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse
<s> ahoy bless your eyes here s old bill barley
<s> here s old bill barley bless your eyes
<s> here s old bill barley on the flat of his back by the lord
<s> lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder here s your old bill barley bless your eyes
<s> ahoy bless you
<s> in this strain of consolation herbert informed me the invisible barley would commune with himself by the day and night together often while it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river
<s> in his two cabin rooms at the top of the house which were fresh and airy and in which mr
<s> barley was less audible than below i found provis comfortably settled
<s> he expressed no alarm and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was softened indefinably for i could not have said how and could never afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly
<s> the opportunity that the day s rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting compeyson
<s> for anything i knew his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction
<s> therefore when herbert and i sat down with him by his fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on wemmick s judgment and sources of information
<s> ay ay dear boy he answered with a grave nod jaggers knows
<s> then i have talked with wemmick said i and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice
<s> this i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and i told him how wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that my chambers had been watched how wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time and my keeping away from him and what wemmick had said about getting him abroad
<s> i added that of course when the time came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might be safest in wemmick s judgment
<s> what was to follow that i did not touch upon neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared peril for my sake
<s> as to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse
<s> he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout
<s> his coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a venture
<s> he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help
<s> herbert who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of wemmick s suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue
<s> we are both good watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes
<s> no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance is worth saving
<s> never mind the season don t you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river you fall into that habit and then who notices or minds do it twenty or fifty times and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty first or fifty first
<s> i liked this scheme and provis was quite elated by it
<s> we agreed that it should be carried into execution and that provis should never recognise us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank
<s> but we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right
<s> our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go remarking to herbert that he and i had better not go home together and that i would take half an hour s start of him
<s> i don t like to leave you here i said to provis though i cannot doubt your being safer here than near me
<s> good bye
<s> dear boy he answered clasping my hands i don t know when we may meet again and i don t like good bye
<s> say good night
<s> good night herbert will go regularly between us and when the time comes you may be certain i shall be ready
<s> good night good night
<s> we thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms and we left him on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stair rail to light us downstairs
<s> looking back at him i thought of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now
<s> old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease
<s> when we got to the foot of the stairs i asked herbert whether he had preserved the name of provis
<s> he replied certainly not and that the lodger was mr
<s> campbell
<s> he also explained that the utmost known of mr
<s> campbell there was that he herbert had mr
<s> campbell consigned to him and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded life
<s> so when we went into the parlour where mrs
<s> whimple and clara were seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in mr
<s> campbell but kept it to myself
<s> when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark eyed girl and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper rope walk had grown quite a different place
<s> old barley might be as old as the hills and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in chinks s basin to fill it to overflowing
<s> and then i thought of estella and of our parting and went home very sadly
<s> all things were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them
<s> the windows of the rooms on that side lately occupied by provis were dark and still and there was no lounger in garden court
<s> i walked past the fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between me and my rooms but i was quite alone
<s> herbert coming to my bedside when he came in for i went straight to bed dispirited and fatigued made the same report
<s> opening one of the windows after that he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour
<s> next day i set myself to get the boat
<s> it was soon done and the boat was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach her within a minute or two
<s> then i began to go out as for training and practice sometimes alone sometimes with herbert
<s> i was often out in cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been out a few times
<s> at first i kept above blackfriars bridge but as the hours of the tide changed i took towards london bridge
<s> it was old london bridge in those days and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation
<s> but i knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith
<s> the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert and i were pulling a pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards the east come down
<s> herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming
<s> still i knew that there was cause for alarm and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched
<s> once received it is a haunting idea how many undesigning persons i suspected of watching me it would be hard to calculate
<s> in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding
<s> herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark when the tide was running down and to think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara
<s> but i thought with dread that it was flowing towards magwitch and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly silently and surely to take him
<s> chapter xlvii
<s> some weeks passed without bringing any change
<s> we waited for wemmick and he made no sign
<s> if i had never known him out of little britain and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the castle i might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him as i did
<s> my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed for money by more than one creditor
<s> even i myself began to know the want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash
<s> but i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans
<s> therefore i had sent him the unopened pocket book by herbert to hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfaction whether it was a false kind or a true i hardly know in not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself
<s> as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that estella was married
<s> fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert to whom i had confided the circumstances of our last interview never to speak of her to me
<s> why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know why did you who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year last month last week
<s> it was an unhappy life that i lived and its one dominant anxiety towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a range of mountains never disappeared from my view
<s> still no new cause for fear arose
<s> let me start from my bed as i would with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as i would with dread for herbert s returning step at night lest it should be fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil news for all that and much more to like purpose the round of things went on
<s> condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could
<s> there were states of the tide when having been down the river i could not get back through the eddy chafed arches and starlings of old london bridge then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be brought up afterwards to the temple stairs
<s> i was not averse to doing this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water side people there
<s> from this slight occasion sprang two meetings that i have now to tell of
<s> one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf at dusk
<s> i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and had turned with the tide
<s> it had been a fine bright day but had become foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the shipping pretty carefully
<s> both in going and returning i had seen the signal in his window all well
<s> as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort myself with dinner at once and as i had hours of dejection and solitude before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go to the play
<s> the theatre where mr
<s> wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that water side neighbourhood it is nowhere now and to that theatre i resolved to go
<s> i was aware that mr
<s> wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather partaken of its decline
<s> he had been ominously heard of through the play bills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of noble birth and a monkey
<s> and herbert had seen him as a predatory tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an outrageous hat all over bells
<s> i dined at what herbert and i used to call a geographical chop house where there were maps of the world in porter pot rims on every half yard of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knives to this day there is scarcely a single chop house within the lord mayor s dominions which is not geographical and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinners
<s> by and by i roused myself and went to the play
<s> there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majesty s service a most excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places and not quite so loose in others who knocked all the little men s hats over their eyes though he was very generous and brave and who wouldn t hear of anybody s paying taxes though he was very patriotic
<s> he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in the cloth and on that property married a young person in bed furniture with great rejoicings the whole population of portsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else s and sing fill fill a certain dark complexioned swab however who wouldn t fill or do anything else that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the boatswain to be as black as his figure head proposed to two other swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually done the swab family having considerable political influence that it took half the evening to set things right and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn t confute with what he had overheard
<s> this led to mr
<s> wopsle s who had never been heard of before coming in with a star and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight acknowledgment of his public services
<s> the boatswain unmanned for the first time respectfully dried his eyes on the jack and then cheering up and addressing mr
<s> wopsle as your honour solicited permission to take him by the fin
<s> mr
<s> wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe and from that corner surveying the public with a discontented eye became aware of me
<s> the second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected mr
<s> wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain fringe for his hair engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner
<s> but he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances for the genius of youthful love being in want of assistance on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter s heart by purposely falling upon the object in a flour sack out of the first floor window summoned a sententious enchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after an apparently violent journey proved to be mr
<s> wopsle in a high crowned hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm
<s> the business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at butted at danced at and flashed at with fires of various colours he had a good deal of time on his hands
<s> and i observed with great surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement
<s> there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of mr
<s> wopsle s eye and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out
<s> i sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch case and still i could not make it out
<s> i was still thinking of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him waiting for me near the door
<s> how do you do said i shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together
<s> i saw that you saw me
<s> saw you mr
<s> pip he returned
<s> yes of course i saw you
<s> but who else was there
<s> who else
<s> it is the strangest thing said mr
<s> wopsle drifting into his lost look again and yet i could swear to him
<s> becoming alarmed i entreated mr
<s> wopsle to explain his meaning
<s> whether i should have noticed him at first but for your being there said mr
<s> wopsle going on in the same lost way i can t be positive yet i think i should
<s> involuntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me when i went home for these mysterious words gave me a chill
<s> oh he can t be in sight said mr
<s> wopsle
<s> he went out before i went off
<s> i saw him go
<s> having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected this poor actor
<s> i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission
<s> therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing
<s> i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you mr
<s> pip till i saw that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a ghost
<s> my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak yet for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with provis
<s> of course i was perfectly sure and safe that provis had not been there
<s> i dare say you wonder at me mr
<s> pip indeed i see you do
<s> but it is so very strange you ll hardly believe what i am going to tell you
<s> i could hardly believe it myself if you told me
<s> indeed said i
<s> no indeed
<s> mr
<s> pip you remember in old times a certain christmas day when you were quite a child and i dined at gargery s and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended
<s> i remember it very well
<s> and you remember that there was a chase after two convicts and that we joined in it and that gargery took you on his back and that i took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could
<s> i remember it all very well
<s> better than he thought except the last clause
<s> and you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other
<s> i see it all before me
<s> and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marshes with the torchlight shining on their faces i am particular about that with the torchlight shining on their faces when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us
<s> yes said i
<s> i remember all that
<s> then mr
<s> pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight
<s> i saw him over your shoulder
<s> steady i thought
<s> i asked him then which of the two do you suppose you saw
<s> the one who had been mauled he answered readily and i ll swear i saw him the more i think of him the more certain i am of him
<s> this is very curious said i with the best assumption i could put on of its being nothing more to me
<s> very curious indeed
<s> i cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeyson s having been behind me like a ghost
<s> for if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun it was in those very moments when he was closest to me and to think that i should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if i had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out and then had found him at my elbow
<s> i could not doubt either that he was there because i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us danger was always near and active
<s> i put such questions to mr
<s> wopsle as when did the man come in he could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man
<s> it was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time
<s> how was he dressed prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought in black
<s> was his face at all disfigured no he believed not
<s> i believed not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention
<s> when mr
<s> wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening we parted
<s> it was between twelve and one o clock when i reached the temple and the gates were shut
<s> no one was near me when i went in and went home
<s> herbert had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire
<s> but there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to wemmick what i had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint
<s> as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the castle i made this communication by letter
<s> i wrote it before i went to bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me
<s> herbert and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious
<s> and we were very cautious indeed more cautious than before if that were possible and i for my part never went near chinks s basin except when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank as i looked at anything else
<s> chapter xlviii
<s> the second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first
<s> i had again left my boat at the wharf below bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me
<s> it was mr
<s> jaggers s hand and he passed it through my arm
<s> as we are going in the same direction pip we may walk together
<s> where are you bound for
<s> for the temple i think said i
<s> don t you know said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in cross examination i do not know for i have not made up my mind
<s> you are going to dine said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> you don t mind admitting that i suppose
<s> no i returned i don t mind admitting that
<s> and are not engaged
<s> i don t mind admitting also that i am not engaged
<s> then said mr
<s> jaggers come and dine with me
<s> i was going to excuse myself when he added wemmick s coming
<s> so i changed my excuse into an acceptance the few words i had uttered serving for the beginning of either and we went along cheapside and slanted off to little britain while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows and the street lamp lighters scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon s bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall
<s> at the office in little britain there was the usual letter writing hand washing candle snuffing and safe locking that closed the business of the day
<s> as i stood idle by mr
<s> jaggers s fire its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo peep with me while the pair of coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted mr
<s> jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding sheets as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients
<s> we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackney coach and as soon as we got there dinner was served
<s> although i should not have thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much as a look to wemmick s walworth sentiments yet i should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way
<s> but it was not to be done
<s> he turned his eyes on mr
<s> jaggers whenever he raised them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one
<s> did you send that note of miss havisham s to mr
<s> pip wemmick mr
<s> jaggers asked soon after we began dinner
<s> no sir returned wemmick it was going by post when you brought mr
<s> pip into the office
<s> here it is
<s> he handed it to his principal instead of to me
<s> it s a note of two lines pip said mr
<s> jaggers handing it on sent up to me by miss havisham on account of her not being sure of your address
<s> she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her
<s> you ll go down
<s> yes said i casting my eyes over the note which was exactly in those terms
<s> when do you think of going down
<s> i have an impending engagement said i glancing at wemmick who was putting fish into the post office that renders me rather uncertain of my time
<s> at once i think
<s> if mr
<s> pip has the intention of going at once said wemmick to mr
<s> jaggers he needn t write an answer you know
<s> receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled that i would go to morrow and said so
<s> wemmick drank a glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at mr
<s> jaggers but not at me
<s> so pip our friend the spider said mr
<s> jaggers has played his cards
<s> he has won the pool
<s> it was as much as i could do to assent
<s> hah he is a promising fellow in his way but he may not have it all his own way
<s> the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to be found out first
<s> if he should turn to and beat her
<s> surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr
<s> jaggers
<s> i didn t say so pip
<s> i am putting a case
<s> if he should turn to and beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be a question of intellect he certainly will not
<s> it would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances because it s a toss up between two results
<s> may i ask what they are
<s> a fellow like our friend the spider answered mr
<s> jaggers either beats or cringes
<s> he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but he either beats or cringes
<s> ask wemmick his opinion
<s> either beats or cringes said wemmick not at all addressing himself to me
<s> so here s to mrs
<s> bentley drummle said mr
<s> jaggers taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb waiter and filling for each of us and for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady s satisfaction to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman it never will be
<s> now molly molly molly molly how slow you are to day
<s> she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the table
<s> as she withdrew her hands from it she fell back a step or two nervously muttering some excuse
<s> and a certain action of her fingers as she spoke arrested my attention
<s> what s the matter said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> nothing
<s> only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather painful to me
<s> the action of her fingers was like the action of knitting
<s> she stood looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go
<s> her look was very intent
<s> surely i had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately
<s> he dismissed her and she glided out of the room
<s> but she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there
<s> i looked at those hands i looked at those eyes i looked at that flowing hair and i compared them with other hands other eyes other hair that i knew of and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life
<s> i looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when i last walked not alone in the ruined garden and through the deserted brewery
<s> i thought how the same feeling had come back when i saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stage coach window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning when i had passed in a carriage not alone through a sudden glare of light in a dark street
<s> i thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a chance swift from estella s name to the fingers with their knitting action and the attentive eyes
<s> and i felt absolutely certain that this woman was estella s mother
<s> mr
<s> jaggers had seen me with estella and was not likely to have missed the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal
<s> he nodded when i said the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the wine again and went on with his dinner
<s> only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the room was very short and mr
<s> jaggers was sharp with her
<s> but her hands were estella s hands and her eyes were estella s eyes and if she had reappeared a hundred times i could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth
<s> it was a dull evening for wemmick drew his wine when it came round quite as a matter of business just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round and with his eyes on his chief sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross examination
<s> as to the quantity of wine his post office was as indifferent and ready as any other post office for its quantity of letters
<s> from my point of view he was the wrong twin all the time and only externally like the wemmick of walworth
<s> we took our leave early and left together
<s> even when we were groping among mr
<s> jaggers s stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air
<s> well said wemmick that s over he s a wonderful man without his living likeness but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine with him and i dine more comfortably unscrewed
<s> i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so
<s> wouldn t say it to anybody but yourself he answered
<s> i know that what is said between you and me goes no further
<s> i asked him if he had ever seen miss havisham s adopted daughter mrs
<s> bentley drummle
<s> he said no
<s> to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke of the aged and of miss skiffins
<s> he looked rather sly when i mentioned miss skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness
<s> wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to mr
<s> jaggers s private house to notice that housekeeper
<s> did i he replied
<s> ah i dare say i did
<s> deuce take me he added suddenly i know i did
<s> i find i am not quite unscrewed yet
<s> a wild beast tamed you called her
<s> and what do you call her
<s> the same
<s> how did mr
<s> jaggers tame her wemmick
<s> that s his secret
<s> she has been with him many a long year
<s> i wish you would tell me her story
<s> i feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it
<s> you know that what is said between you and me goes no further
<s> well wemmick replied i don t know her story that is i don t know all of it
<s> but what i do know i ll tell you
<s> we are in our private and personal capacities of course
<s> of course
<s> a score or so of years ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for murder and was acquitted
<s> she was a very handsome young woman and i believe had some gypsy blood in her
<s> anyhow it was hot enough when it was up as you may suppose
<s> but she was acquitted
<s> mr
<s> jaggers was for her pursued wemmick with a look full of meaning and worked the case in a way quite astonishing
<s> it was a desperate case and it was comparatively early days with him then and he worked it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to have made him
<s> he worked it himself at the police office day after day for many days contending against even a committal and at the trial where he couldn t work it himself sat under counsel and every one knew put in all the salt and pepper
<s> the murdered person was a woman a woman a good ten years older very much larger and very much stronger
<s> it was a case of jealousy
<s> they both led tramping lives and this woman in gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy
<s> the murdered woman more a match for the man certainly in point of years was found dead in a barn near hounslow heath
<s> there had been a violent struggle perhaps a fight
<s> she was bruised and scratched and torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked
<s> now there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it mr
<s> jaggers principally rested his case
<s> you may be sure said wemmick touching me on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then though he sometimes does now
<s> i had told wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner party
<s> well sir wemmick went on it happened happened don t you see that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look
<s> she had only a bruise or two about her nothing for a tramp but the backs of her hands were lacerated and the question was was it with finger nails now mr
<s> jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there
<s> but the boldest point he made was this it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder frantically destroyed her child by this man some three years old to revenge herself upon him
<s> mr
<s> jaggers worked that in this way we say these are not marks of finger nails but marks of brambles and we show you the brambles
<s> you say they are marks of finger nails and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child
<s> you must accept all consequences of that hypothesis
<s> for anything we know she may have destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands
<s> what then you are not trying her for the murder of her child why don t you as to this case if you will have scratches we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them to sum up sir said wemmick mr
<s> jaggers was altogether too many for the jury and they gave in
<s> has she been in his service ever since
<s> yes but not only that said wemmick she went into his service immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now
<s> she has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed from the beginning
<s> do you remember the sex of the child
<s> said to have been a girl
<s> you have nothing more to say to me to night
<s> nothing
<s> i got your letter and destroyed it
<s> nothing
<s> we exchanged a cordial good night and i went home with new matter for my thoughts though with no relief from the old
<s> chapter xlix
<s> putting miss havisham s note in my pocket that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went down again by the coach next day
<s> but i alighted at the halfway house and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for i sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways and to leave it in the same manner
<s> the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the high street
<s> the nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves
<s> the cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding observation than they had ever had before so the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that estella was gone out of it for ever
<s> an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the gate
<s> the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone
<s> miss havisham was not in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing
<s> looking in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the ashy fire
<s> doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old chimney piece where she could see me when she raised her eyes
<s> there was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge her with
<s> as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house her eyes rested on me
<s> she stared and said in a low voice is it real
<s> it is i pip
<s> mr
<s> jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost no time
<s> thank you
<s> thank you
<s> as i brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down i remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me
<s> i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here and to show you that i am not all stone
<s> but perhaps you can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart
<s> when i said some reassuring words she stretched out her tremulous right hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again before i understood the action or knew how to receive it
<s> you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do something useful and good
<s> something that you would like done is it not
<s> something that i would like done very much
<s> what is it
<s> i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership
<s> i had not got far into it when i judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said
<s> it seemed to be so for when i stopped speaking many moments passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact
<s> do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me
<s> no no i answered how can you think so miss havisham i stopped because i thought you were not following what i said
<s> perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head
<s> begin again and let me look at something else
<s> stay now tell me
<s> she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend
<s> i went on with my explanation and told her how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how in this i was disappointed
<s> that part of the subject i reminded her involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they were the weighty secrets of another
<s> so said she assenting with her head but not looking at me
<s> and how much money is wanting to complete the purchase
<s> i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum
<s> nine hundred pounds
<s> if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as you have kept your own
<s> quite as faithfully
<s> and your mind will be more at rest
<s> much more at rest
<s> are you very unhappy now
<s> she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted tone of sympathy
<s> i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed me
<s> she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid her forehead on it
<s> i am far from happy miss havisham but i have other causes of disquiet than any you know of
<s> they are the secrets i have mentioned
<s> after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again
<s> it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness
<s> is it true
<s> too true
<s> can i only serve you pip by serving your friend regarding that as done is there nothing i can do for you yourself
<s> nothing
<s> i thank you for the question
<s> i thank you even more for the tone of the question
<s> but there is nothing
<s> she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing
<s> there were none there and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck
<s> you are still on friendly terms with mr
<s> jaggers
<s> quite
<s> i dined with him yesterday
<s> this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend
<s> i keep no money here but if you would rather mr
<s> jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it to you
<s> thank you miss havisham i have not the least objection to receiving it from him
<s> she read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money
<s> i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached and put it in mine
<s> all this she did without looking at me
<s> my name is on the first leaf
<s> if you can ever write under my name i forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it
<s> o miss havisham said i i can do it now
<s> there have been sore mistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and i want forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you
<s> she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees at my feet with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have been raised to heaven from her mother s side
<s> to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame
<s> i entreated her to rise and got my arms about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept
<s> i had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking
<s> she was not kneeling now but was down upon the ground
<s> o she cried despairingly
<s> what have i done what have i done
<s> if you mean miss havisham what have you done to injure me let me answer
<s> very little
<s> i should have loved her under any circumstances
<s> is she married
<s> yes
<s> it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so
<s> what have i done what have i done she wrung her hands and crushed her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again
<s> what have i done
<s> i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her
<s> that she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found vengeance in i knew full well
<s> but that in shutting out the light of day she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew equally well
<s> and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world
<s> until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a looking glass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know what i had done
<s> what have i done what have i done and so again twenty fifty times over what had she done
<s> miss havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience
<s> but estella is a different case and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years
<s> yes yes i know it
<s> but pip my dear there was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection
<s> my dear believe this when she first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own
<s> at first i meant no more
<s> well well said i
<s> i hope so
<s> but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place
<s> better i could not help saying to have left her a natural heart even to be bruised or broken
<s> with that miss havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then burst out again what had she done
<s> if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me
<s> miss havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left this neighbourhood
<s> it has inspired me with great commiseration and i hope i understand it and its influences
<s> does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to estella not as she is but as she was when she first came here
<s> she was seated on the ground with her arms on the ragged chair and her head leaning on them
<s> she looked full at me when i said this and replied go on
<s> whose child was estella
<s> she shook her head
<s> you don t know
<s> she shook her head again
<s> but mr
<s> jaggers brought her here or sent her here
<s> brought her here
<s> will you tell me how that came about
<s> she answered in a low whisper and with caution i had been shut up in these rooms a long time i don t know how long you know what time the clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear and love and save from my fate
<s> i had first seen him when i sent for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the newspapers before i and the world parted
<s> he told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child
<s> one night he brought her here asleep and i called her estella
<s> might i ask her age then
<s> two or three
<s> she herself knows nothing but that she was left an orphan and i adopted her
<s> so convinced i was of that woman s being her mother that i wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind
<s> but to any mind i thought the connection here was clear and straight
<s> what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview i had succeeded on behalf of herbert miss havisham had told me all she knew of estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind
<s> no matter with what other words we parted we parted
<s> twilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air
<s> i called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving
<s> for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it
<s> by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which the rain of years had fallen since rotting them in many places and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end i made my way to the ruined garden
<s> i went all round it round by the corner where herbert and i had fought our battle round by the paths where estella and i had walked
<s> so cold so lonely so dreary all
<s> taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it and walked through
<s> i was going out at the opposite door not easy to open now for the damp wood had started and swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus when i turned my head to look back
<s> a childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action and i fancied that i saw miss havisham hanging to the beam
<s> so strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before i knew it was a fancy though to be sure i was there in an instant
<s> the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gates where i had once wrung my hair after estella had wrung my heart
<s> passing on into the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs and assure myself that miss havisham was as safe and well as i had left her
<s> i took the latter course and went up
<s> i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards me
<s> in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away i saw a great flaming light spring up
<s> in the same moment i saw her running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high
<s> i had a double caped great coat on and over my arm another thick coat
<s> that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over her that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and all the ugly things that sheltered there that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself that this occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or thought or knew i did
<s> i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded bridal dress
<s> then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door
<s> i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like a prisoner who might escape and i doubt if i even knew who she was or why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us
<s> she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even touched
<s> assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire would break out again and consume her
<s> when i got up on the surgeon s coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling
<s> on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock
<s> by the surgeon s directions her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries
<s> when i saw her again an hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick and had heard her say that she would lie one day
<s> though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had covered her to the throat with white cotton wool and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her
<s> i found on questioning the servants that estella was in paris and i got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post
<s> miss havisham s family i took upon myself intending to communicate with mr
<s> matthew pocket only and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest
<s> this i did next day through herbert as soon as i returned to town
<s> there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had happened though with a certain terrible vivacity
<s> towards midnight she began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice what have i done and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like mine
<s> and then take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her she never changed the order of these three sentences but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word
<s> as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being taken up clear of the town
<s> at about six o clock of the morning therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her
<s> chapter l
<s> my hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in the morning
<s> my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less severely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse
<s> my right hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the fingers
<s> it was bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm those i carried in a sling and i could only wear my coat like a cloak loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck
<s> my hair had been caught by the fire but not my head or face
<s> when herbert had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me
<s> he was the kindest of nurses and at stated times took off the bandages and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for
<s> at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell
<s> if i dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss havisham s cries and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head
<s> this pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i suffered and herbert seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention engaged
<s> neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it
<s> that was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our agreeing without agreement to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours not of so many weeks
<s> my first question when i saw herbert had been of course whether all was well down the river as he replied in the affirmative with perfect confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away
<s> but then as herbert changed the bandages more by the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it spontaneously
<s> i sat with provis last night handel two good hours
<s> where was clara
<s> dear little thing said herbert
<s> she was up and down with gruffandgrim all the evening
<s> he was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight
<s> i doubt if he can hold out long though
<s> what with rum and pepper and pepper and rum i should think his pegging must be nearly over
<s> and then you will be married herbert
<s> how can i take care of the dear child otherwise lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa my dear boy and i ll sit down here and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes
<s> i was speaking of provis
<s> do you know handel he improves
<s> i said to you i thought he was softened when i last saw him
<s> so you did
<s> and so he is
<s> he was very communicative last night and told me more of his life
<s> you remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with
<s> did i hurt you
<s> i had started but not under his touch
<s> his words had given me a start
<s> i had forgotten that herbert but i remember it now you speak of it
<s> well he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is
<s> shall i tell you or would it worry you just now
<s> tell me by all means
<s> every word
<s> herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for
<s> your head is cool he said touching it
<s> quite said i
<s> tell me what provis said my dear herbert
<s> it seems said herbert there s a bandage off most charmingly and now comes the cool one makes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow don t it but it will be comfortable presently it seems that the woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman revengeful handel to the last degree
<s> to what last degree
<s> murder
<s> does it strike too cold on that sensitive place
<s> i don t feel it
<s> how did she murder whom did she murder
<s> why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name said herbert but she was tried for it and mr
<s> jaggers defended her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to provis
<s> it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim and there had been a struggle in a barn
<s> who began it or how fair it was or how unfair may be doubtful but how it ended is certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled
<s> was the woman brought in guilty
<s> no she was acquitted
<s> my poor handel i hurt you
<s> it is impossible to be gentler herbert
<s> yes what else
<s> this acquitted young woman and provis had a little child a little child of whom provis was exceedingly fond
<s> on the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the young woman presented herself before provis for one moment and swore that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he should never see it again then she vanished
<s> there s the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but the right hand which is a far easier job
<s> i can do it better by this light than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i don t see the poor blistered patches too distinctly
<s> you don t think your breathing is affected my dear boy you seem to breathe quickly
<s> perhaps i do herbert
<s> did the woman keep her oath
<s> there comes the darkest part of provis s life
<s> she did
<s> that is he says she did
<s> why of course my dear boy returned herbert in a tone of surprise and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me
<s> he says it all
<s> i have no other information
<s> no to be sure
<s> now whether pursued herbert he had used the child s mother ill or whether he had used the child s mother well provis doesn t say but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and forbearance towards her
<s> therefore fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called abel out of whom the jealousy arose
<s> after the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the child s mother
<s> i want to ask
<s> a moment my dear boy and i have done
<s> that evil genius compeyson the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder
<s> it was clear last night that this barbed the point of provis s animosity
<s> i want to know said i and particularly herbert whether he told you when this happened
<s> particularly let me remember then what he said as to that
<s> his expression was a round score o year ago and a most directly after i took up wi compeyson
<s> how old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard
<s> i think in my seventh year
<s> ay
<s> it had happened some three or four years then he said and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have been about your age
<s> herbert said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire
<s> by the firelight answered herbert coming close again
<s> look at me
<s> i do look at you my dear boy
<s> touch me
<s> i do touch you my dear boy
<s> you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night
<s> n no my dear boy said herbert after taking time to examine me
<s> you are rather excited but you are quite yourself
<s> i know i am quite myself
<s> and the man we have in hiding down the river is estella s father
<s> chapter li
<s> what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving estella s parentage i cannot say
<s> it will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own
<s> but when herbert and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter down that i ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see mr
<s> jaggers and come at the bare truth
<s> i really do not know whether i felt that i did this for estella s sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me
<s> perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth
<s> any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street that night
<s> herbert s representations that if i did i should probably be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitive s safety would depend upon me alone restrained my impatience
<s> on the understanding again and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to mr
<s> jaggers to morrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts looked after and to stay at home
<s> early next morning we went out together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left herbert to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain
<s> there were periodical occasions when mr
<s> jaggers and wemmick went over the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all things straight
<s> on these occasions wemmick took his books and papers into mr
<s> jaggers s room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office
<s> finding such clerk on wemmick s post that morning i knew what was going on but i was not sorry to have mr
<s> jaggers and wemmick together as wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to compromise him
<s> my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders favoured my object
<s> although i had sent mr
<s> jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence than it had been before
<s> while i described the disaster mr
<s> jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire
<s> wemmick leaned back in his chair staring at me with his hands in the pockets of his trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post
<s> the two brutal casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn t smell fire at the present moment
<s> my narrative finished and their questions exhausted i then produced miss havisham s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for herbert
<s> mr
<s> jaggers s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to wemmick with instructions to draw the check for his signature
<s> while that was in course of being done i looked on at wemmick as he wrote and mr
<s> jaggers poising and swaying himself on his well polished boots looked on at me
<s> i am sorry pip said he as i put the check in my pocket when he had signed it that we do nothing for you
<s> miss havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she could do nothing for me and i told her no
<s> everybody should know his own business said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> and i saw wemmick s lips form the words portable property
<s> i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr jaggers but every man ought to know his own business best
<s> every man s business said wemmick rather reproachfully towards me is portable property
<s> as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at heart i said turning on mr
<s> jaggers
<s> i did ask something of miss havisham however sir
<s> i asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me all she possessed
<s> did she said mr
<s> jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself
<s> hah i don t think i should have done so if i had been miss havisham
<s> but she ought to know her own business best
<s> i know more of the history of miss havisham s adopted child than miss havisham herself does sir
<s> i know her mother
<s> mr
<s> jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother
<s> i have seen her mother within these three days
<s> yes said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> and so have you sir
<s> and you have seen her still more recently
<s> yes said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> perhaps i know more of estella s history than even you do said i
<s> i know her father too
<s> a certain stop that mr
<s> jaggers came to in his manner he was too self possessed to change his manner but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop assured me that he did not know who her father was
<s> this i had strongly suspected from provis s account as herbert had repeated it of his having kept himself dark which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not mr
<s> jaggers s client until some four years later and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity
<s> but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness on mr
<s> jaggers s part before though i was quite sure of it now
<s> so you know the young lady s father pip said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> yes i replied and his name is provis from new south wales
<s> even mr
<s> jaggers started when i said those words
<s> it was the slightest start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket handkerchief
<s> how wemmick received the announcement i am unable to say for i was afraid to look at him just then lest mr
<s> jaggers s sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us
<s> and on what evidence pip asked mr
<s> jaggers very coolly as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does provis make this claim
<s> he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence
<s> for once the powerful pocket handkerchief failed
<s> my reply was so unexpected that mr
<s> jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance folded his arms and looked with stern attention at me though with an immovable face
<s> then i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the one reservation that i left him to infer that i knew from miss havisham what i in fact knew from wemmick
<s> i was very careful indeed as to that
<s> nor did i look towards wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for some time silently meeting mr
<s> jaggers s look
<s> when i did at last turn my eyes in wemmick s direction i found that he had unposted his pen and was intent upon the table before him
<s> hah said mr
<s> jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the table
<s> what item was it you were at wemmick when mr
<s> pip came in
<s> but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me
<s> i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had made and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits
<s> i represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted
<s> i said that i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted assurance of the truth from him
<s> and if he asked me why i wanted it and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he cared for such poor dreams that i had loved estella dearly and long and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world
<s> and seeing that mr
<s> jaggers stood quite still and silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to wemmick and said wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle heart
<s> i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the innocent cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life
<s> and i entreat you to say a word for me to mr
<s> jaggers and to represent to him that all circumstances considered he ought to be more open with me
<s> i have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than mr
<s> jaggers and wemmick did after this apostrophe
<s> at first a misgiving crossed me that wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment but it melted as i saw mr
<s> jaggers relax into something like a smile and wemmick become bolder
<s> what s all this said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> you with an old father and you with pleasant and playful ways
<s> well returned wemmick
<s> if i don t bring em here what does it matter
<s> pip said mr
<s> jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london
<s> not a bit of it returned wemmick growing bolder and bolder
<s> i think you re another
<s> again they exchanged their former odd looks each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in
<s> you with a pleasant home said mr
<s> jaggers
<s> since it don t interfere with business returned wemmick let it be so
<s> now i look at you sir i shouldn t wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days when you re tired of all this work
<s> mr
<s> jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times and actually drew a sigh
<s> pip said he we won t talk about poor dreams you know more about such things than i having much fresher experience of that kind
<s> but now about this other matter
<s> i ll put a case to you
<s> mind i admit nothing
<s> he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing
<s> now pip said mr
<s> jaggers put this case
<s> put the case that a woman under such circumstances as you have mentioned held her child concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child
<s> put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up
<s> i follow you sir
<s> put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction
<s> put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported neglected cast out qualified in all ways for the hangman and growing up to be hanged
<s> put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his net to be prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow
<s> i follow you sir
<s> put the case pip that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this power i know what you did and how you did it
<s> you came so and so you did such and such things to divert suspicion
<s> i have tracked you through it all and i tell it you all
<s> part with the child unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced
<s> give the child into my hands and i will do my best to bring you off
<s> if you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost your child is still saved
<s> put the case that this was done and that the woman was cleared
<s> i understand you perfectly
<s> but that i make no admissions
<s> that you make no admissions
<s> and wemmick repeated no admissions
<s> put the case pip that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman s intellects and that when she was set at liberty she was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered
<s> put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out by asserting his power over her in the old way
<s> do you comprehend the imaginary case
<s> quite
<s> put the case that the child grew up and was married for money
<s> that the mother was still living
<s> that the father was still living
<s> that the mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many miles furlongs yards if you like of one another
<s> that the secret was still a secret except that you had got wind of it
<s> put that last case to yourself very carefully
<s> i do
<s> i ask wemmick to put it to himself very carefully
<s> and wemmick said i do
<s> for whose sake would you reveal the secret for the father s i think he would not be much the better for the mother
<s> for the mother s i think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was
<s> for the daughter s i think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to disgrace after an escape of twenty years pretty secure to last for life
<s> but add the case that you had loved her pip and had made her the subject of those poor dreams which have at one time or another been in the heads of more men than you think likely then i tell you that you had better and would much sooner when you had thought well of it chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and then pass the chopper on to wemmick there to cut that off too
<s> i looked at wemmick whose face was very grave
<s> he gravely touched his lips with his forefinger
<s> i did the same
<s> mr
<s> jaggers did the same
<s> now wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what item was it you were at when mr
<s> pip came in
<s> standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times with this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other
<s> for this reason i suppose they were now inflexible with one another mr
<s> jaggers being highly dictatorial and wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment
<s> i had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they got on very well indeed together
<s> but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls
<s> this individual who either in his own person or in that of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting
<s> as he imparted this melancholy circumstance to wemmick mr
<s> jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings mike s eye happened to twinkle with a tear
<s> what are you about demanded wemmick with the utmost indignation
<s> what do you come snivelling here for
<s> i didn t go to do it mr
<s> wemmick
<s> you did said wemmick
<s> how dare you you re not in a fit state to come here if you can t come here without spluttering like a bad pen
<s> what do you mean by it
<s> a man can t help his feelings mr
<s> wemmick pleaded mike
<s> his what demanded wemmick quite savagely
<s> say that again
<s> now look here my man said mr
<s> jaggers advancing a step and pointing to the door
<s> get out of this office
<s> i ll have no feelings here
<s> get out
<s> it serves you right said wemmick get out
<s> so the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and mr
<s> jaggers and wemmick appeared to have re established their good understanding and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch
<s> chapter lii
<s> from little britain i went with my check in my pocket to miss skiffins s brother the accountant and miss skiffins s brother the accountant going straight to clarriker s and bringing clarriker to me i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement
<s> it was the only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done since i was first apprised of my great expectations
<s> clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a small branch house in the east which was much wanted for the extension of the business and that herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more settled
<s> and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves
<s> but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes little imagining that he told me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara barley to the land of the arabian nights and of me going out to join them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the nile and seeing wonders
<s> without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans i felt that herbert s way was clearing fast and that old bill barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his daughter would soon be happily provided for
<s> we had now got into the month of march
<s> my left arm though it presented no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i was still unable to get a coat on
<s> my right arm was tolerably restored disfigured but fairly serviceable
<s> on a monday morning when herbert and i were at breakfast i received the following letter from wemmick by the post
<s> walworth
<s> burn this as soon as read
<s> early in the week or say wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try it
<s> now burn
<s> when i had shown this to herbert and had put it in the fire but not before we had both got it by heart we considered what to do
<s> for of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view
<s> i have thought it over again and again said herbert and i think i know a better course than taking a thames waterman
<s> take startop
<s> a good fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honourable
<s> i had thought of him more than once
<s> but how much would you tell him herbert
<s> it is necessary to tell him very little
<s> let him suppose it a mere freak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting provis aboard and away
<s> you go with him
<s> no doubt
<s> where
<s> it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the point almost indifferent what port we made for hamburg rotterdam antwerp the place signified little so that he was out of england
<s> any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do
<s> i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot
<s> as foreign steamers would leave london at about the time of high water our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb tide and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one
<s> the time when one would be due where we lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we made inquiries beforehand
<s> herbert assented to all this and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations
<s> we found that a steamer for hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel
<s> but we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each
<s> we then separated for a few hours i to get at once such passports as were necessary herbert to see startop at his lodgings
<s> we both did what we had to do without any hindrance and when we met again at one o clock reported it done
<s> i for my part was prepared with passports herbert had seen startop and he was more than ready to join
<s> those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer our charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our object we should make way enough
<s> we arranged that herbert should not come home to dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening that he should not go there at all to morrow evening tuesday that he should prepare provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when he saw us approach and not sooner that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that monday night and that he should be communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board
<s> these precautions well understood by both of us i went home
<s> on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter in the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not ill written
<s> it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its contents were these
<s> if you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to night or to morrow night at nine and to come to the little sluice house by the limekiln you had better come
<s> if you want information regarding your uncle provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time
<s> you must come alone
<s> bring this with you
<s> i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter
<s> what to do now i could not tell
<s> and the worst was that i must decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take me down in time for to night
<s> to morrow night i could not think of going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight
<s> and again for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself
<s> if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have gone
<s> having hardly any time for consideration my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour i resolved to go
<s> i should certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle provis
<s> that coming on wemmick s letter and the morning s busy preparation turned the scale
<s> it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind
<s> yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way i left a note in pencil for herbert telling him that as i should be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry down and back to ascertain for myself how miss havisham was faring
<s> i had then barely time to get my great coat lock up the chambers and make for the coach office by the short by ways
<s> if i had taken a hackney chariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard
<s> i was the only inside passenger jolting away knee deep in straw when i came to myself
<s> for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning
<s> the morning hurry and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as i had waited for wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last
<s> and now i began to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried people are strangers
<s> still the reference to provis by name mastered everything
<s> i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing it if that be reasoning in case any harm should befall him through my not going how could i ever forgive myself
<s> it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside in my disabled state
<s> avoiding the blue boar i put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner
<s> while it was preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss havisham she was still very ill though considered something better
<s> my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i dined in a little octagonal common room like a font
<s> as i was not able to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me
<s> this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain me with my own story of course with the popular feature that pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes
<s> do you know the young man said i
<s> know him repeated the landlord
<s> ever since he was no height at all
<s> does he ever come back to this neighbourhood
<s> ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friends now and again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him
<s> what man is that
<s> him that i speak of said the landlord
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook
<s> is he ungrateful to no one else
<s> no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he can t
<s> and why because pumblechook done everything for him
<s> does pumblechook say so
<s> say so replied the landlord
<s> he han t no call to say so
<s> but does he say so
<s> it would turn a man s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it sir said the landlord
<s> i thought yet joe dear joe you never tell of it
<s> long suffering and loving joe you never complain
<s> nor you sweet tempered biddy
<s> your appetite s been touched like by your accident said the landlord glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat
<s> try a tenderer bit
<s> no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the fire
<s> i can eat no more
<s> please take it away
<s> i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to joe as through the brazen impostor pumblechook
<s> the falser he the truer joe the meaner he the nobler joe
<s> my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire for an hour or more
<s> the striking of the clock aroused me but not from my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round my neck and went out
<s> i had previously sought in my pockets for the letter that i might refer to it again but i could not find it and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach
<s> i knew very well however that the appointed place was the little sluice house by the limekiln on the marshes and the hour nine
<s> towards the marshes i now went straight having no time to spare
<s> 0393m
<s> chapter liii
<s> it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed lands and passed out upon the marshes
<s> beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon
<s> in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the piled mountains of cloud
<s> there was a melancholy wind and the marshes were very dismal
<s> a stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back
<s> but i knew them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had no excuse for returning being there
<s> so having come there against my inclination i went on against it
<s> the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor that in which we had pursued the convicts
<s> my back was turned towards the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old lights away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder
<s> i knew the limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks
<s> at first i had to shut some gates after me and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds
<s> but after a little while i seemed to have the whole flats to myself
<s> it was another half hour before i drew near to the kiln
<s> the lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fires were made up and left and no workmen were visible
<s> hard by was a small stone quarry
<s> it lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about
<s> coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation for the rude path lay through it i saw a light in the old sluice house
<s> i quickened my pace and knocked at the door with my hand
<s> waiting for some reply i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and how the house of wood with a tiled roof would not be proof against the weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime and how the choking vapour of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me
<s> still there was no answer and i knocked again
<s> no answer still and i tried the latch
<s> it rose under my hand and the door yielded
<s> looking in i saw a lighted candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead
<s> as there was a loft above i called is there any one here but no voice answered
<s> then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine called again is there any one here there being still no answer i went out at the door irresolute what to do
<s> it was beginning to rain fast
<s> seeing nothing save what i had seen already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter of the doorway looking out into the night
<s> while i was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the wick were long
<s> i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running noose thrown over my head from behind
<s> now said a suppressed voice with an oath i ve got you
<s> what is this i cried struggling
<s> who is it help help help
<s> not only were my arms pulled close to my sides but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain
<s> sometimes a strong man s hand sometimes a strong man s breast was set against my mouth to deaden my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall
<s> and now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and i ll make short work of you
<s> faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little
<s> but it was bound too tight for that
<s> i felt as if having been burnt before it were now being boiled
<s> the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter
<s> after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he wanted and began to strike a light
<s> i strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of the match even those but fitfully
<s> the tinder was damp no wonder there and one after another the sparks died out
<s> the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel
<s> as the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hands and touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table but nothing more
<s> presently i saw his blue lips again breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and showed me orlick
<s> whom i had looked for i don t know
<s> i had not looked for him
<s> seeing him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eyes upon him
<s> he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation and dropped the match and trod it out
<s> then he put the candle away from him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me
<s> i made out that i was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall a fixture there the means of ascent to the loft above
<s> now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time i ve got you
<s> unbind me
<s> let me go
<s> ah he returned i ll let you go
<s> i ll let you go to the moon i ll let you go to the stars
<s> all in good time
<s> why have you lured me here
<s> don t you know said he with a deadly look
<s> why have you set upon me in the dark
<s> because i mean to do it all myself
<s> one keeps a secret better than two
<s> o you enemy you enemy
<s> his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arms folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a malignity in it that made me tremble
<s> as i watched him in silence he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a brass bound stock
<s> do you know this said he making as if he would take aim at me
<s> do you know where you saw it afore speak wolf
<s> yes i answered
<s> 0399m
<s> you cost me that place
<s> you did
<s> speak
<s> what else could i do
<s> you did that and that would be enough without more
<s> how dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman i liked
<s> when did i
<s> when didn t you it was you as always give old orlick a bad name to her
<s> you gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself
<s> i could have done you no harm if you had done yourself none
<s> you re a liar
<s> and you ll take any pains and spend any money to drive me out of this country will you said he repeating my words to biddy in the last interview i had with her
<s> now i ll tell you a piece of information
<s> it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to night
<s> ah if it was all your money twenty times told to the last brass farden as he shook his heavy hand at me with his mouth snarling like a tiger s i felt that it was true
<s> what are you going to do to me
<s> i m a going said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force i m a going to have your life
<s> he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again
<s> you was always in old orlick s way since ever you was a child
<s> you goes out of his way this present night
<s> he ll have no more on you
<s> you re dead
<s> i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave
<s> for a moment i looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none
<s> more than that said he folding his arms on the table again i won t have a rag of you i won t have a bone of you left on earth
<s> i ll put your body in the kiln i d carry two such to it on my shoulders and let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing
<s> my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death
<s> estella s father would believe i had deserted him would be taken would die accusing me even herbert would doubt me when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had called at miss havisham s gate for only a moment joe and biddy would never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed through
<s> the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death
<s> and so quick were my thoughts that i saw myself despised by unborn generations estella s children and their children while the wretch s words were yet on his lips
<s> now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beast which is wot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up for i ll have a good look at you and a good goad at you
<s> o you enemy
<s> it had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again though few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the hopelessness of aid
<s> but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips
<s> above all things i resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some last poor resistance to him
<s> softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as i did of heaven melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors still if i could have killed him even in dying i would have done it
<s> he had been drinking and his eyes were red and bloodshot
<s> around his neck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days
<s> he brought the bottle to his lips and took a fiery drink from it and i smelt the strong spirits that i saw flash into his face
<s> wolf said he folding his arms again old orlick s a going to tell you somethink
<s> it was you as did for your shrew sister
<s> again my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her death before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words
<s> it was you villain said i
<s> i tell you it was your doing i tell you it was done through you he retorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us
<s> i come upon her from behind as i come upon you to night
<s> i giv it her i left her for dead and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldn t have come to life again
<s> but it warn t old orlick as did it it was you
<s> you was favoured and he was bullied and beat
<s> old orlick bullied and beat eh now you pays for it
<s> you done it now you pays for it
<s> he drank again and became more ferocious
<s> i saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it
<s> i distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me
<s> i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life
<s> i knew that when i was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept towards me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do as he had done in my sister s case make all haste to the town and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses
<s> my rapid mind pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapour creeping over it into which i should have dissolved
<s> it was not only that i could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words but that what he did say presented pictures to me and not mere words
<s> in the excited and exalted state of my brain i could not think of a place without seeing it or of persons without seeing them
<s> it is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himself who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring that i knew of the slightest action of his fingers
<s> when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which he sat and pushed the table aside
<s> then he took up the candle and shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood before me looking at me and enjoying the sight
<s> wolf i ll tell you something more
<s> it was old orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night
<s> i saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps
<s> i saw the shadows of the heavy stair rails thrown by the watchman s lantern on the wall
<s> i saw the rooms that i was never to see again here a door half open there a door closed all the articles of furniture around
<s> and why was old orlick there i ll tell you something more wolf
<s> you and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country so far as getting a easy living in it goes and i ve took up with new companions and new masters
<s> some of em writes my letters when i wants em wrote do you mind writes my letters wolf they writes fifty hands they re not like sneaking you as writes but one
<s> i ve had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life since you was down here at your sister s burying
<s> i han t seen a way to get you safe and i ve looked arter you to know your ins and outs
<s> for says old orlick to himself somehow or another i ll have him what when i looks for you i finds your uncle provis eh
<s> mill pond bank and chinks s basin and the old green copper rope walk all so clear and plain provis in his rooms the signal whose use was over pretty clara the good motherly woman old bill barley on his back all drifting by as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea
<s> you with a uncle too why i know d you at gargery s when you was so small a wolf that i could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead as i d thoughts o doing odd times when i see you loitering amongst the pollards on a sunday and you hadn t found no uncles then
<s> no not you but when old orlick come for to hear that your uncle provis had most like wore the leg iron wot old orlick had picked up filed asunder on these meshes ever so many year ago and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it like a bullock as he means to drop you hey when he come for to hear that hey
<s> in his savage taunting he flared the candle so close at me that i turned my face aside to save it from the flame
<s> ah he cried laughing after doing it again the burnt child dreads the fire old orlick knowed you was burnt old orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle provis away old orlick s a match for you and know d you d come to night now i ll tell you something more wolf and this ends it
<s> there s them that s as good a match for your uncle provis as old orlick has been for you
<s> let him ware them when he s lost his nevvy let him ware them when no man can t find a rag of his dear relation s clothes nor yet a bone of his body
<s> there s them that can t and that won t have magwitch yes i know the name alive in the same land with them and that s had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land as that he couldn t and shouldn t leave it unbeknown and put them in danger
<s> p raps it s them that writes fifty hands and that s not like sneaking you as writes but one
<s> ware compeyson magwitch and the gallows
<s> he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table
<s> i had thought a prayer and had been with joe and biddy and herbert before he turned towards me again
<s> there was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall
<s> within this space he now slouched backwards and forwards
<s> his great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides and with his eyes scowling at me
<s> i had no grain of hope left
<s> wild as my inward hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts i could yet clearly understand that unless he had resolved that i was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told
<s> of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed it away
<s> light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet
<s> he swallowed slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at me no more
<s> the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand and licked up
<s> then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped and i saw in his hand a stone hammer with a long heavy handle
<s> the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and struggled with all my might
<s> it was only my head and my legs that i could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until then unknown that was within me
<s> in the same instant i heard responsive shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door heard voices and tumult and saw orlick emerge from a struggle of men as if it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly out into the night
<s> after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the same place with my head on some one s knee
<s> my eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall when i came to myself had opened on it before my mind saw it and thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i was in the place where i had lost it
<s> too indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who supported me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it a face
<s> the face of trabb s boy
<s> i think he s all right said trabb s boy in a sober voice but ain t he just pale though
<s> at these words the face of him who supported me looked over into mine and i saw my supporter to be
<s> herbert great heaven
<s> softly said herbert
<s> gently handel
<s> don t be too eager
<s> and our old comrade startop i cried as he too bent over me
<s> remember what he is going to assist us in said herbert and be calm
<s> the allusion made me spring up though i dropped again from the pain in my arm
<s> the time has not gone by herbert has it what night is to night how long have i been here for i had a strange and strong misgiving that i had been lying there a long time a day and a night two days and nights more
<s> the time has not gone by
<s> it is still monday night
<s> thank god
<s> and you have all to morrow tuesday to rest in said herbert
<s> but you can t help groaning my dear handel
<s> what hurt have you got can you stand
<s> yes yes said i i can walk
<s> i have no hurt but in this throbbing arm
<s> they laid it bare and did what they could
<s> it was violently swollen and inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched
<s> but they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it
<s> in a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice house and were passing through the quarry on our way back
<s> trabb s boy trabb s overgrown young man now went before us with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door
<s> but the moon was a good two hours higher than when i had last seen the sky and the night though rainy was much lighter
<s> the white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer before i thought a thanksgiving now
<s> entreating herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue which at first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining quiet i learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i was gone
<s> its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him
<s> his uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an hour s consideration he set off for the coach office with startop who volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went down
<s> finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he resolved to follow in a post chaise
<s> so he and startop arrived at the blue boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but finding neither went on to miss havisham s where they lost me
<s> hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes
<s> among the loungers under the boar s archway happened to be trabb s boy true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business and trabb s boy had seen me passing from miss havisham s in the direction of my dining place
<s> thus trabb s boy became their guide and with him they went out to the sluice house though by the town way to the marshes which i had avoided
<s> now as they went along herbert reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to provis s safety and bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by himself and stole round the house two or three times endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within
<s> as he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely followed by the other two
<s> when i told herbert what had passed within the house he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it was and getting out a warrant
<s> but i had already considered that such a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might be fatal to provis
<s> there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing orlick at that time
<s> for the present under the circumstances we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to trabb s boy who i am convinced would have been much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln
<s> not that trabb s boy was of a malignant nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody s expense
<s> when we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all
<s> wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london that night three in the post chaise the rather as we should then be clear away before the night s adventure began to be talked of
<s> herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain on the journey
<s> it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went at once to bed and lay in bed all day
<s> my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for to morrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of itself
<s> it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon me that to morrow was
<s> so anxiously looked forward to charged with such consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near
<s> no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day yet this again increased my restlessness
<s> i started at every footstep and every sound believing that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell me so
<s> i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it
<s> as the days wore on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to morrow morning altogether mastered me
<s> my burning arm throbbed and my burning head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander
<s> i counted up to high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew in prose and verse
<s> it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind i dozed for some moments or forgot then i would say to myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious
<s> they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and gave me cooling drinks
<s> whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion i had had in the sluice house that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone
<s> about midnight i got out of bed and went to herbert with the conviction that i had been asleep for four and twenty hours and that wednesday was past
<s> it was the last self exhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept soundly
<s> wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window
<s> the winking lights upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon
<s> the river still dark and mysterious was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky
<s> as i looked along the clustered roofs with church towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters
<s> from me too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well
<s> herbert lay asleep in his bed and our old fellow student lay asleep on the sofa
<s> i could not dress myself without help but i made up the fire which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them
<s> in good time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us
<s> when it turns at nine o clock said herbert cheerfully look out for us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank
<s> chapter liv
<s> it was one of those march days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade
<s> we had our pea coats with us and i took a bag
<s> of all my worldly possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag
<s> where i might go what i might do or when i might return were questions utterly unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for it was wholly set on provis s safety
<s> i only wondered for the passing moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered circumstances i should next see those rooms if ever
<s> we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all
<s> of course i had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order
<s> after a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went on board and cast off herbert in the bow i steering
<s> it was then about high water half past eight
<s> our plan was this
<s> the tide beginning to run down at nine and being with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned and row against it until dark
<s> we should then be well in those long reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is broad and solitary where the water side inhabitants are very few and where lone public houses are scattered here and there of which we could choose one for a resting place
<s> there we meant to lie by all night
<s> the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from london at about nine on thursday morning
<s> we should know at what time to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have another chance
<s> we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel
<s> the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realise the condition in which i had been a few hours before
<s> the crisp air the sunlight the movement on the river and the moving river itself the road that ran with us seeming to sympathise with us animate us and encourage us on freshened me with new hope
<s> i felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friends and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day
<s> at that time the steam traffic on the thames was far below its present extent and watermen s boats were far more numerous
<s> of barges sailing colliers and coasting traders there were perhaps as many as now but of steam ships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part so many
<s> early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly
<s> old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its oyster boats and dutchmen and the white tower and traitor s gate and we were in among the tiers of shipping
<s> here were the leith aberdeen and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside here were colliers by the score and score with the coal whippers plunging off stages on deck as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled over the side into barges here at her moorings was to morrow s steamer for rotterdam of which we took good notice and here to morrow s for hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed
<s> and now i sitting in the stern could see with a faster beating heart mill pond bank and mill pond stairs
<s> is he there said herbert
<s> not yet
<s> right he was not to come down till he saw us
<s> can you see his signal
<s> not well from here but i think i see it
<s> now i see him pull both
<s> easy herbert
<s> oars
<s> we touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board and we were off again
<s> he had a boat cloak with him and a black canvas bag and he looked as like a river pilot as my heart could have wished
<s> dear boy he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his seat
<s> faithful dear boy well done
<s> thankye thankye
<s> again among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty chain cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the moment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood and shaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the figure head of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds as is done by many johns and the betsy of yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head in and out hammers going in ship builders yards saws going at timber clashing engines going at things unknown pumps going in leaky ships capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible sea creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen in and out out at last upon the clearer river where the ships boys might take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind
<s> at the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had looked warily for any token of our being suspected
<s> i had seen none
<s> we certainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat
<s> if we had been waited on by any boat i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on or to make her purpose evident
<s> but we held our own without any appearance of molestation
<s> he had his boat cloak on him and looked as i have said a natural part of the scene
<s> it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us
<s> he was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country he was not disposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it but he had no notion of meeting danger half way
<s> when it came upon him he confronted it but it must come before he troubled himself
<s> if you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day betwixt four walls you d envy me
<s> but you don t know what it is
<s> i think i know the delights of freedom i answered
<s> ah said he shaking his head gravely
<s> but you don t know it equal to me
<s> you must have been under lock and key dear boy to know it equal to me but i ain t a going to be low
<s> it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he should have endangered his freedom and even his life
<s> but i reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man
<s> i was not far out since he said after smoking a little
<s> you see dear boy when i was over yonder t other side the world i was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for all i was a growing rich
<s> everybody knowed magwitch and magwitch could come and magwitch could go and nobody s head would be troubled about him
<s> they ain t so easy concerning me here dear boy wouldn t be leastwise if they knowed where i was
<s> if all goes well said i you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours
<s> well he returned drawing a long breath i hope so
<s> and think so
<s> he dipped his hand in the water over the boat s gunwale and said smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me
<s> ay i s pose i think so dear boy
<s> we d be puzzled to be more quiet and easy going than we are at present
<s> but it s a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water p raps as makes me think it i was a thinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what i catches hold of
<s> nor yet we can t no more hold their tide than i can hold this
<s> and it s run through my fingers and gone you see holding up his dripping hand
<s> but for your face i should think you were a little despondent said i
<s> not a bit on it dear boy it comes of flowing on so quiet and of that there rippling at the boat s head making a sort of a sunday tune
<s> maybe i m a growing a trifle old besides
<s> he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of england
<s> yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat and he was stepping out i hinted that i thought he would be safest where he was and he said
<s> do you dear boy and quietly sat down again
<s> the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the sunshine was very cheering
<s> the tide ran strong i took care to lose none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well
<s> by imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend
<s> as our charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a boat or two s length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us
<s> and soon the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks
<s> our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hour s rest proved full as much as they wanted
<s> we got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about
<s> it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed stranded and still
<s> for now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed and the last green barge straw laden with a brown sail had followed and some ballast lighters shaped like a child s first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud and a little squat shoal lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud and an old landing stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud
<s> we pushed off again and made what way we could
<s> it was much harder work now but herbert and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down
<s> by that time the river had lifted us a little so that we could see above the bank
<s> there was the red sun on the low level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black and there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull
<s> as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full would not rise early we held a little council a short one for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find
<s> so they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a house
<s> thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles
<s> it was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galley fire smoking and flaring looked like a comfortable home
<s> the night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning and what light we had seemed to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars
<s> at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed
<s> as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction
<s> here and there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek and we were all suspicious of such places and eyed them nervously
<s> sometimes what was that ripple one of us would say in a low voice
<s> or another is that a boat yonder and afterwards we would fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels
<s> at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by
<s> leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light to be in a window of a public house
<s> it was a dirty place enough and i dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various liquors to drink
<s> also there were two double bedded rooms such as they were the landlord said
<s> no other company was in the house than the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low water mark too
<s> with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boat hook and all else and hauled her up for the night
<s> we made a very good meal by the kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms herbert and startop were to occupy one i and our charge the other
<s> we found the air as carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than i should have thought the family possessed
<s> but we considered ourselves well off notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found
<s> while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the jack who was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore asked me if we had seen a four oared galley going up with the tide when i told him no he said she must have gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there
<s> they must ha thought better on t for some reason or another said the jack and gone down
<s> a four oared galley did you say said i
<s> a four said the jack and two sitters
<s> did they come ashore here
<s> they put in with a stone two gallon jar for some beer
<s> i d ha been glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling physic in it
<s> why
<s> i know why said the jack
<s> he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud had washed into his throat
<s> he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye who seemed to rely greatly on his jack he thinks they was what they wasn t
<s> i knows what i thinks observed the jack
<s> you thinks custom us jack said the landlord
<s> i do said the jack
<s> then you re wrong jack
<s> am i
<s> in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on again
<s> he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything
<s> why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then jack asked the landlord vacillating weakly
<s> done with their buttons returned the jack
<s> chucked em overboard
<s> swallered em
<s> sowed em to come up small salad
<s> done with their buttons
<s> don t be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and pathetic way
<s> a custom us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they comes betwixt him and his own light
<s> a four and two sitters don t go hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both with and against another without there being custom us at the bottom of it
<s> saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord having no one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject
<s> this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy
<s> the dismal wind was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened
<s> a four oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that i could not get rid of
<s> when i had induced provis to go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this time knew the state of the case and held another council
<s> whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer s time which would be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the morning was the question we discussed
<s> on the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the steamer s time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with the tide
<s> having settled to do this we returned into the house and went to bed
<s> i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a few hours
<s> when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled me
<s> rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the window
<s> it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw two men looking into her
<s> they passed by under the window looking at nothing else and they did not go down to the landing place which i could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction of the nore
<s> my first impulse was to call up herbert and show him the two men going away
<s> but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day than i and were fatigued i forbore
<s> going back to my window i could see the two men moving over the marsh
<s> in that light however i soon lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and fell asleep again
<s> we were up early
<s> as we walked to and fro all four together before breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen
<s> again our charge was the least anxious of the party
<s> it was very likely that the men belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no thought of us
<s> i tried to persuade myself that it was so as indeed it might easily be
<s> however i proposed that he and i should walk away together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about noon
<s> this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern
<s> he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder
<s> one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger not he and that he was reassuring me
<s> we spoke very little
<s> as we approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while i went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night
<s> he complied and i went on alone
<s> there was no boat off the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there
<s> but to be sure the tide was high and there might have been some footprints under water
<s> when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round
<s> we got aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer
<s> by that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o clock and we began to look out for her smoke
<s> but it was half past one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer
<s> as they were coming on at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity of saying good bye to herbert and startop
<s> we had all shaken hands cordially and neither herbert s eyes nor mine were quite dry when i saw a four oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us and row out into the same track
<s> a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer s smoke by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible coming head on
<s> i called to herbert and startop to keep before the tide that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured provis to sit quite still wrapped in his cloak
<s> he answered cheerily trust to me dear boy and sat like a statue
<s> meantime the galley which was very skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen alongside
<s> leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled
<s> of the two sitters one held the rudder lines and looked at us attentively as did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up much as provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us
<s> not a word was spoken in either boat
<s> startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face
<s> she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder
<s> i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the galley hailed us
<s> i answered
<s> you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines
<s> that s the man wrapped in the cloak
<s> his name is abel magwitch otherwise provis
<s> i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender and you to assist
<s> at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew he ran the galley abroad of us
<s> they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to our gunwale before we knew what they were doing
<s> this caused great confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly
<s> in the same moment i saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner s shoulder and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically
<s> still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley
<s> still in the same moment i saw that the face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago
<s> still in the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me
<s> it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand mill weirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past i was taken on board the galley
<s> herbert was there and startop was there but our boat was gone and the two convicts were gone
<s> what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern
<s> presently a dark object was seen in it bearing towards us on the tide
<s> no man spoke but the steersman held up his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and true before it
<s> as it came nearer i saw it to be magwitch swimming but not swimming freely
<s> he was taken on board and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles
<s> the galley was kept steady and the silent eager look out at the water was resumed
<s> but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not understanding what had happened came on at speed
<s> by the time she had been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water
<s> the look out was kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but everybody knew that it was hopeless now
<s> at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise
<s> here i was able to get some comforts for magwitch provis no longer who had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the head
<s> he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising
<s> the injury to his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought he had received against the side of the galley
<s> he added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him magwitch out of our boat and the endeavour of his captor to keep him in it had capsized us
<s> he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other s arms and that there had been a struggle under water and that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away
<s> i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me
<s> the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard
<s> when i asked this officer s permission to change the prisoner s wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the public house he gave it readily merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him
<s> so the pocket book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer s
<s> he further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london but declined to accord that grace to my two friends
<s> the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore
<s> his interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on
<s> probably it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay
<s> we remained at the public house until the tide turned and then magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board
<s> herbert and startop were to get to london by land as soon as they could
<s> we had a doleful parting and when i took my place by magwitch s side i felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived
<s> for now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a series of years
<s> i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to joe
<s> his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on and often he could not repress a groan
<s> i tried to rest him on the arm i could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was unquestionably best that he should die
<s> that there were still living people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not doubt
<s> that he would be leniently treated i could not hope
<s> he who had been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest
<s> as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake
<s> dear boy he answered i m quite content to take my chance
<s> i ve seen my boy and he can be a gentleman without me
<s> no
<s> i had thought about that while we had been there side by side
<s> no
<s> apart from any inclinations of my own i understood wemmick s hint now
<s> i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to the crown
<s> lookee here dear boy said he it s best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now
<s> only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger wemmick
<s> sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the last o many times and i don t ask no more
<s> i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be near you
<s> please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me
<s> i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his throat softened now like all the rest of him
<s> it was a good thing that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not otherwise have thought of until too late that he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished
<s> chapter lv
<s> he was taken to the police court next day and would have been immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison ship from which he had once escaped to speak to his identity
<s> nobody doubted it but compeyson who had meant to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give the required evidence
<s> i had gone direct to mr
<s> jaggers at his private house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and mr
<s> jaggers on the prisoner s behalf would admit nothing
<s> it was the sole resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us
<s> i imparted to mr
<s> jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth
<s> mr
<s> jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having let it slip through my fingers and said we must memorialise by and by and try at all events for some of it
<s> but he did not conceal from me that although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them
<s> i understood that very well
<s> i was not related to the outlaw or connected with him by any recognisable tie he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his apprehension and to do so now would be idle
<s> i had no claim and i finally resolved and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one
<s> there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some accurate knowledge of magwitch s affairs
<s> when his body was found many miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets notes were still legible folded in a case he carried
<s> among these were the name of a banking house in new south wales where a sum of money was and the designation of certain lands of considerable value
<s> both these heads of information were in a list that magwitch while in prison gave to mr
<s> jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit
<s> his ignorance poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe with mr
<s> jaggers s aid
<s> after three days delay during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison ship the witness came and completed the easy case
<s> he was committed to take his trial at the next sessions which would come on in a month
<s> it was at this dark time of my life that herbert returned home one evening a good deal cast down and said
<s> my dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave you
<s> his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he thought
<s> we shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i am very much afraid i must go handel when you most need me
<s> herbert i shall always need you because i shall always love you but my need is no greater now than at another time
<s> you will be so lonely
<s> i have not leisure to think of that said i
<s> you know that i am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i should be with him all day long if i could
<s> and when i come away from him you know that my thoughts are with him
<s> the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both of us that we could not refer to it in plainer words
<s> my dear fellow said herbert let the near prospect of our separation for it is very near be my justification for troubling you about yourself
<s> have you thought of your future
<s> no for i have been afraid to think of any future
<s> but yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear handel it must not be dismissed
<s> i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly words go with me
<s> i will said i
<s> in this branch house of ours handel we must have a
<s> i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said a clerk
<s> a clerk
<s> and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner
<s> now handel in short my dear boy will you come to me
<s> there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy
<s> clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert pursued and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in her eyes to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her husband s friend that he is her friend too
<s> we should get on so well handel
<s> i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered
<s> firstly my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly
<s> secondly yes secondly there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative
<s> but if you thought herbert that you could without doing any injury to your business leave the question open for a little while
<s> for any while cried herbert
<s> six months a year
<s> not so long as that said i
<s> two or three months at most
<s> herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week
<s> and clara said i
<s> the dear little thing returned herbert holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts but he won t last long
<s> mrs
<s> whimple confides to me that he is certainly going
<s> not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go
<s> i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert and then i shall come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i will walk quietly into the nearest church
<s> remember the blessed darling comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book and hasn t a notion about her grandpapa
<s> what a fortune for the son of my mother
<s> on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbert full of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave me as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches
<s> i went into a coffee house to write a little note to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and over again and then went to my lonely home if it deserved the name for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere
<s> on the stairs i encountered wemmick who was coming down after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door
<s> i had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had come in his private and personal capacity to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure
<s> the late compeyson said wemmick had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being always in trouble that i heard what i did
<s> i kept my ears open seeming to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that would be the best time for making the attempt
<s> i can only suppose now that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to deceive his own instruments
<s> you don t blame me i hope mr
<s> pip i am sure i tried to serve you with all my heart
<s> i am as sure of that wemmick as you can be and i thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship
<s> thank you thank you very much
<s> it s a bad job said wemmick scratching his head and i assure you i haven t been so cut up for a long time
<s> what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property
<s> dear me
<s> what i think of wemmick is the poor owner of the property
<s> yes to be sure said wemmick
<s> of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him and i d put down a five pound note myself to get him out of it
<s> but what i look at is this
<s> the late compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been saved
<s> whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved
<s> that s the difference between the property and the owner don t you see
<s> i invited wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to walworth
<s> he accepted the invitation
<s> while he was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to it and after having appeared rather fidgety
<s> what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday mr
<s> pip
<s> why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months
<s> these twelve years more likely said wemmick
<s> yes
<s> i m going to take a holiday
<s> more than that i m going to take a walk
<s> more than that i m going to ask you to take a walk with me
<s> i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then when wemmick anticipated me
<s> i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts mr
<s> pip
<s> but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness
<s> it ain t a long walk and it s an early one
<s> say it might occupy you including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve
<s> couldn t you stretch a point and manage it
<s> he had done so much for me at various times that this was very little to do for him
<s> i said i could manage it would manage it and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too
<s> at his particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time
<s> punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday morning and was received by wemmick himself who struck me as looking tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on
<s> within there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits
<s> the aged must have been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his bedroom i observed that his bed was empty
<s> when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was considerably surprised to see wemmick take up a fishing rod and put it over his shoulder
<s> why we are not going fishing said i
<s> no returned wemmick but i like to walk with one
<s> i thought this odd however i said nothing and we set off
<s> we went towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts wemmick said suddenly
<s> halloa here s a church
<s> there was nothing very surprising in that but again i was rather surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea
<s> let s go in
<s> we went in wemmick leaving his fishing rod in the porch and looked all round
<s> in the mean time wemmick was diving into his coat pockets and getting something out of paper there
<s> halloa said he
<s> here s a couple of pair of gloves let s put em on
<s> as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the post office was widened to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions
<s> they were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side door escorting a lady
<s> halloa said wemmick
<s> here s miss skiffins let s have a wedding
<s> that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white
<s> the aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of hymen
<s> the old gentleman however experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on that wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe resistance
<s> by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to perfection
<s> the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at those fatal rails
<s> true to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation i heard wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoat pocket before the service began halloa here s a ring
<s> i acted in the capacity of backer or best man to the bridegroom while a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby s made a feint of being the bosom friend of miss skiffins
<s> the responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergyman s being unintentionally scandalised and it happened thus
<s> when he said who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentleman not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments
<s> upon which the clergyman said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice now aged p
<s> you know who giveth to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying that he gave all right john all right my boy and the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day
<s> it was completely done however and when we were going out of church wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and put the cover on again
<s> mrs
<s> wemmick more heedful of the future put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green
<s> now mr
<s> pip said wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishing rod as we came out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding party
<s> breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity
<s> it was pleasant to observe that mrs
<s> wemmick no longer unwound wemmick s arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a high backed chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done
<s> we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on table wemmick said provided by contract you know don t be afraid of it i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could
<s> wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hands with him and wished him joy
<s> thankee said wemmick rubbing his hands
<s> she s such a manager of fowls you have no idea
<s> you shall have some eggs and judge for yourself
<s> i say mr
<s> pip calling me back and speaking low
<s> this is altogether a walworth sentiment please
<s> i understand
<s> not to be mentioned in little britain said i
<s> wemmick nodded
<s> after what you let out the other day mr
<s> jaggers may as well not know of it
<s> he might think my brain was softening or something of the kind
<s> chapter lvi
<s> he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions
<s> he had broken two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great pain and difficulty which increased daily
<s> it was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke very little
<s> but he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he ought to hear
<s> being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after the first day or so into the infirmary
<s> this gave me opportunities of being with him that i could not otherwise have had
<s> and but for his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a determined prison breaker and i know not what else
<s> although i saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state
<s> i do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better he wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day when the prison door closed upon him
<s> the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out
<s> i sometimes derived an impression from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances
<s> but he never justified himself by a hint tending that way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape
<s> it happened on two or three occasions in my presence that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him
<s> a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child
<s> as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him complain
<s> when the sessions came round mr
<s> jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions
<s> it was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long and was refused
<s> the trial came on at once and when he was put to the bar he was seated in a chair
<s> no objection was made to my getting close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me
<s> the trial was very short and very clear
<s> such things as could be said for him were said how he had taken to industrious habits and had thriven lawfully and reputably
<s> but nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury
<s> it was impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty
<s> at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death
<s> but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me i could scarcely believe even as i write these words that i saw two and thirty men and women put before the judge to receive that sentence together
<s> foremost among the two and thirty was he seated that he might get breath enough to keep life in him
<s> the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment down to the drops of april rain on the windows of the court glittering in the rays of april sun
<s> penned in the dock as i again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine were the two and thirty men and women some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and weeping some covering their faces some staring gloomily about
<s> there had been shrieks from among the women convicts but they had been stilled and a hush had succeeded
<s> the sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great gallery full of people a large theatrical audience looked on as the two and thirty and the judge were solemnly confronted
<s> then the judge addressed them
<s> among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments and punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years and who under circumstances of great violence and daring had made his escape and been re sentenced to exile for life
<s> that miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and honest life
<s> but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had come back to the country where he was proscribed
<s> being here presently denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had resisted them and had he best knew whether by express design or in the blindness of his hardihood caused the death of his denouncer to whom his whole career was known
<s> the appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this aggravated case he must prepare himself to die
<s> the sun was striking in at the great windows of the court through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of light between the two and thirty and the judge linking both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all things and cannot err
<s> rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again
<s> there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say to the rest
<s> then they were all formally doomed and some of them were supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hands and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about
<s> he went last of all because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly and he held my hand while all the others were removed and while the audience got up putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me
<s> i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorder s report was made but in the dread of his lingering on i began that night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my sake
<s> i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could and when i had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the crown itself
<s> for several days and nights after he was sentenced i took no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed in these appeals
<s> and after i had sent them in i could not keep away from the places where they were but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when i was near them
<s> in this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening wandering by those offices and houses where i had left the petitions
<s> to the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty spring night with their ranges of stern shut up mansions and their long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association
<s> the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more strictly kept
<s> seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs
<s> nobody was hard with him or with me
<s> there was duty to be done and it was done but not harshly
<s> the officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked always joined in the same report
<s> as the days went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would subside again
<s> sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to understand his meaning very well
<s> the number of the days had risen to ten when i saw a greater change in him than i had seen yet
<s> his eyes were turned towards the door and lighted up as i entered
<s> dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed i thought you was late
<s> but i knowed you couldn t be that
<s> it is just the time said i
<s> i waited for it at the gate
<s> you always waits at the gate don t you dear boy
<s> yes
<s> not to lose a moment of the time
<s> thank ee dear boy thank ee
<s> god bless you you ve never deserted me dear boy
<s> i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once meant to desert him
<s> and what s the best of all he said you ve been more comfortable alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone
<s> that s best of all
<s> he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty
<s> do what he would and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling
<s> are you in much pain to day
<s> i don t complain of none dear boy
<s> you never do complain
<s> he had spoken his last words
<s> he smiled and i understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast
<s> i laid it there and he smiled again and put both his hands upon it
<s> the allotted time ran out while we were thus but looking round i found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered you needn t go yet
<s> i thanked him gratefully and asked might i speak to him if he can hear me
<s> the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away
<s> the change though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me
<s> dear magwitch i must tell you now at last
<s> you understand what i say
<s> a gentle pressure on my hand
<s> you had a child once whom you loved and lost
<s> a stronger pressure on my hand
<s> she lived and found powerful friends
<s> she is living now
<s> she is a lady and very beautiful
<s> and i love her
<s> with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips
<s> then he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hands lying on it
<s> the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and his head dropped quietly on his breast
<s> mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two men who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better words that i could say beside his bed than o lord be merciful to him a sinner
<s> chapter lvii
<s> now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them
<s> at once i put bills up in the windows for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs
<s> i ought rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that i was falling very ill
<s> the late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away i knew that it was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless as to that
<s> for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the floor anywhere according as i happened to sink down with a heavy head and aching limbs and no purpose and no power
<s> then there came one night which appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i found i could not do so
<s> whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there whether i had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror not knowing how i had got out of bed whether i had found myself lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs and that the lights were blown out whether i had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss havisham was consuming within it these were things that i tried to settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on my bed
<s> but the vapour of a limekiln would come between me and them disordering them all and it was through the vapour at last that i saw two men looking at me
<s> what do you want i asked starting i don t know you
<s> well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the shoulder this is a matter that you ll soon arrange i dare say but you re arrested
<s> what is the debt
<s> hundred and twenty three pound fifteen six
<s> jeweller s account i think
<s> what is to be done
<s> you had better come to my house said the man
<s> i keep a very nice house
<s> i made some attempt to get up and dress myself
<s> when i next attended to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me
<s> i still lay there
<s> you see my state said i
<s> i would come with you if i could but indeed i am quite unable
<s> if you take me from here i think i shall die by the way
<s> perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to believe that i was better than i thought
<s> forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread i don t know what they did except that they forbore to remove me
<s> that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i confounded impossible existences with my own identity that i was a brick in the house wall and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me that i was a steel beam of a vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered off that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own remembrance and did in some sort know at the time
<s> that i sometimes struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and would then sink exhausted in their arms and suffer them to lay me down i also knew at the time
<s> but above all i knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people who when i was very ill would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face and would be much dilated in size above all i say i knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to settle down into the likeness of joe
<s> after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did not change
<s> whoever came about me still settled down into joe
<s> i opened my eyes in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside joe
<s> i opened my eyes in the day and sitting on the window seat smoking his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw joe
<s> i asked for cooling drink and the dear hand that gave it me was joe s
<s> i sank back on my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of joe
<s> at last one day i took courage and said is it joe
<s> and the dear old home voice answered which it air old chap
<s> o joe you break my heart look angry at me joe
<s> strike me joe
<s> tell me of my ingratitude
<s> don t be so good to me
<s> for joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him
<s> which dear old pip old chap said joe you and me was ever friends
<s> and when you re well enough to go out for a ride what larks
<s> after which joe withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards me wiping his eyes
<s> and as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering o god bless him o god bless this gentle christian man
<s> joe s eyes were red when i next found him beside me but i was holding his hand and we both felt happy
<s> how long dear joe
<s> which you meantersay pip how long have your illness lasted dear old chap
<s> yes joe
<s> it s the end of may pip
<s> to morrow is the first of june
<s> and have you been here all that time dear joe
<s> pretty nigh old chap
<s> for as i says to biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe leather but wealth were not a object on his part and marriage were the great wish of his hart
<s> it is so delightful to hear you joe but i interrupt you in what you said to biddy
<s> which it were said joe that how you might be amongst strangers and that how you and me having been ever friends a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble
<s> and biddy her word were go to him without loss of time
<s> that said joe summing up with his judicial air were the word of biddy
<s> go to him biddy say without loss of time
<s> in short i shouldn t greatly deceive you joe added after a little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that young woman were without a minute s loss of time
<s> there joe cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times whether i felt inclined for it or not and that i was to submit myself to all his orders
<s> so i kissed his hand and lay quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it
<s> evidently biddy had taught joe to write
<s> as i lay in bed looking at him it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter
<s> my bedstead divested of its curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sitting room as the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day
<s> at my own writing table pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles joe now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the pen tray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow bar or sledgehammer
<s> it was necessary for joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen spluttering extensively
<s> he had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into space and seemed quite satisfied with the result
<s> occasionally he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling block but on the whole he got on very well indeed and when he had signed his name and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the effect of his performance from various points of view as it lay there with unbounded satisfaction
<s> not to make joe uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to talk much i deferred asking him about miss havisham until next day
<s> he shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered
<s> is she dead joe
<s> why you see old chap said joe in a tone of remonstrance and by way of getting at it by degrees i wouldn t go so far as to say that for that s a deal to say but she ain t
<s> living joe
<s> that s nigher where it is said joe she ain t living
<s> did she linger long joe
<s> arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you was put to it a week said joe still determined on my account to come at everything by degrees
<s> dear joe have you heard what becomes of her property
<s> well old chap said joe it do appear that she had settled the most of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss estella
<s> but she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident leaving a cool four thousand to mr
<s> matthew pocket
<s> and why do you suppose above all things pip she left that cool four thousand unto him because of pip s account of him the said matthew
<s> i am told by biddy that air the writing said joe repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good account of him the said matthew
<s> and a cool four thousand pip
<s> i never discovered from whom joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool
<s> this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i had done
<s> i asked joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies
<s> miss sarah said joe she have twenty five pound perannium fur to buy pills on account of being bilious
<s> miss georgiana she have twenty pound down
<s> mrs
<s> what s the name of them wild beasts with humps old chap
<s> camels said i wondering why he could possibly want to know
<s> joe nodded
<s> mrs
<s> camels by which i presently understood he meant camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night
<s> the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give me great confidence in joe s information
<s> and now said joe you ain t that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to day
<s> old orlick he s been a bustin open a dwelling ouse
<s> whose said i
<s> not i grant you but what his manners is given to blusterous said joe apologetically still a englishman s ouse is his castle and castles must not be busted cept when done in war time
<s> and wotsume er the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart
<s> is it pumblechook s house that has been broken into then
<s> that s it pip said joe and they took his till and they took his cash box and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles and they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out
<s> but he knowed orlick and orlick s in the county jail
<s> by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation
<s> i was slow to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and joe stayed with me and i fancied i was little pip again
<s> for the tenderness of joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need that i was like a child in his hands
<s> he would sit and talk to me in the old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone
<s> he did everything for me except the household work for which he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on his first arrival
<s> which i do assure you pip he would often say in explanation of that liberty i found her a tapping the spare bed like a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale
<s> which she would have tapped yourn next and draw d it off with you a laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup tureen and wegetable dishes and the wine and spirits in your wellington boots
<s> we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship
<s> and when the day came and an open carriage was got into the lane joe wrapped me up took me in his arms carried me down to it and put me in as if i were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature
<s> and joe got in beside me and we drove away together into the country where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass and sweet summer scents filled all the air
<s> the day happened to be sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought how it had grown and changed and how the little wild flowers had been forming and the voices of the birds had been strengthening by day and by night under the sun and under the stars while poor i lay burning and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace
<s> but when i heard the sunday bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt that i was not nearly thankful enough that i was too weak yet to be even that and i laid my head on joe s shoulder as i had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much for my young senses
<s> more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used to talk lying on the grass at the old battery
<s> there was no change whatever in joe
<s> exactly what he had been in my eyes then he was in my eyes still just as simply faithful and as simply right
<s> when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried me so easily across the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful christmas day when he had carried me over the marshes
<s> we had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of my late history he was acquainted with
<s> i was so doubtful of myself now and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i ought to refer to it when he did not
<s> have you heard joe i asked him that evening upon further consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was
<s> i heerd returned joe as it were not miss havisham old chap
<s> did you hear who it was joe
<s> well i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the bank notes at the jolly bargemen pip
<s> so it was
<s> astonishing said joe in the placidest way
<s> did you hear that he was dead joe i presently asked with increasing diffidence
<s> which him as sent the bank notes pip
<s> yes
<s> i think said joe after meditating a long time and looking rather evasively at the window seat as i did hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction
<s> did you hear anything of his circumstances joe
<s> not partickler pip
<s> if you would like to hear joe i was beginning when joe got up and came to my sofa
<s> lookee here old chap said joe bending over me
<s> ever the best of friends ain t us pip
<s> i was ashamed to answer him
<s> wery good then said joe as if i had answered that s all right that s agreed upon
<s> then why go into subjects old chap which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary there s subjects enough as betwixt two sech without onnecessary ones
<s> lord to think of your poor sister and her rampages and don t you remember tickler
<s> i do indeed joe
<s> lookee here old chap said joe
<s> i done what i could to keep you and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations
<s> for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it were not so much said joe in his favourite argumentative way that she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it
<s> i noticed that
<s> it ain t a grab at a man s whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister was quite welcome that ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment
<s> but when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up and says to himself where is the good as you are a doing i grant you i see the arm says the man but i don t see the good
<s> i call upon you sir therefore to pint out the good
<s> the man says i observed as joe waited for me to speak
<s> the man says joe assented
<s> is he right that man
<s> dear joe he is always right
<s> well old chap said joe then abide by your words
<s> if he s always right which in general he s more likely wrong he s right when he says this supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you was a little child you kep it mostly because you know d as j
<s> gargery s power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his inclinations
<s> theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects
<s> biddy giv herself a deal o trouble with me afore i left for i am almost awful dull as i should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should so put it
<s> both of which said joe quite charmed with his logical arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say
<s> namely
<s> you mustn t go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets
<s> the delicacy with which joe dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and kindness with which biddy who with her woman s wit had found me out so soon had prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind
<s> but whether joe knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not understand
<s> another thing in joe that i could not understand when it first began to develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of was this as i became stronger and better joe became a little less easy with me
<s> in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old names the dear old pip old chap that now were music in my ears
<s> i too had fallen into the old ways only happy and thankful that he let me
<s> but imperceptibly though i held by them fast joe s hold upon them began to slacken and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was all mine
<s> ah had i given joe no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off had i given joe s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as i got stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away
<s> it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the temple gardens leaning on joe s arm that i saw this change in him very plainly
<s> we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the river and i chanced to say as we got up
<s> see joe i can walk quite strongly
<s> now you shall see me walk back by myself
<s> which do not overdo it pip said joe but i shall be happy fur to see you able sir
<s> the last word grated on me but how could i remonstrate i walked no further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker than i was and asked joe for his arm
<s> joe gave it me but was thoughtful
<s> i for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing change in joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts
<s> that i was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come down to i do not seek to conceal but i hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one
<s> he would want to help me out of his little savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i must not suffer him to do it
<s> it was a thoughtful evening with both of us
<s> but before we went to bed i had resolved that i would wait over to morrow to morrow being sunday and would begin my new course with the new week
<s> on monday morning i would speak to joe about this change i would lay aside this last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thoughts that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go out to herbert and then the change would be conquered for ever
<s> as i cleared joe cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too
<s> we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and then walked in the fields
<s> i feel thankful that i have been ill joe i said
<s> dear old pip old chap you re a most come round sir
<s> it has been a memorable time for me joe
<s> likeways for myself sir joe returned
<s> we have had a time together joe that i can never forget
<s> there were days once i know that i did for a while forget but i never shall forget these
<s> pip said joe appearing a little hurried and troubled there has been larks
<s> and dear sir what have been betwixt us have been
<s> at night when i had gone to bed joe came into my room as he had done all through my recovery
<s> he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well as in the morning
<s> yes dear joe quite
<s> and are always a getting stronger old chap
<s> yes dear joe steadily
<s> joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and said in what i thought a husky voice good night
<s> when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of my resolution to tell joe all without delay
<s> i would tell him before breakfast
<s> i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him for it was the first day i had been up early
<s> i went to his room and he was not there
<s> not only was he not there but his box was gone
<s> i hurried then to the breakfast table and on it found a letter
<s> these were its brief contents
<s> not wishful to intrude i have departured fur you are well again dear pip and will do better without
<s> jo
<s> p
<s> s
<s> ever the best of friends
<s> enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i had been arrested
<s> down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite recovered
<s> i had never dreamed of joe s having paid the money but joe had paid it and the receipt was in his name
<s> what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts and had formed into a settled purpose
<s> the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time
<s> then i would say to her biddy i think you once liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since
<s> if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier of you that i was not much but a little
<s> and biddy it shall rest with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with joe or whether i shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer
<s> and now dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you
<s> such was my purpose
<s> after three days more of recovery i went down to the old place to put it in execution
<s> and how i sped in it is all i have left to tell
<s> chapter lviii
<s> the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighbourhood before i got there
<s> i found the blue boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a great change in the boar s demeanour
<s> whereas the boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of property
<s> it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so often made so easily
<s> the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post chaises up the yard
<s> but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom
<s> early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled round by satis house
<s> there were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows announcing a sale by auction of the household furniture and effects next week
<s> the house itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled down
<s> lot 1 was marked in whitewashed knock knee letters on the brew house lot 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up
<s> other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already
<s> stepping in for a moment at the open gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there i saw the auctioneer s clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue compiler pen in hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often pushed along to the tune of old clem
<s> when i got back to my breakfast in the boar s coffee room i found mr
<s> pumblechook conversing with the landlord
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and addressed me in the following terms
<s> young man i am sorry to see you brought low
<s> but what else could be expected what else could be expected
<s> as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it
<s> william said mr
<s> pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table
<s> and has it come to this has it come to this
<s> i frowningly sat down to my breakfast
<s> mr
<s> pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea before i could touch the teapot with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last
<s> william said mr
<s> pumblechook mournfully put the salt on
<s> in happier times addressing me i think you took sugar and did you take milk you did
<s> sugar and milk
<s> william bring a watercress
<s> thank you said i shortly but i don t eat watercresses
<s> you don t eat em returned mr
<s> pumblechook sighing and nodding his head several times as if he might have expected that and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall
<s> true
<s> the simple fruits of the earth
<s> no
<s> you needn t bring any william
<s> i went on with my breakfast and mr
<s> pumblechook continued to stand over me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did
<s> little more than skin and bone mused mr
<s> pumblechook aloud
<s> and yet when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach
<s> this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers
<s> hah he went on handing me the bread and butter
<s> and air you a going to joseph
<s> in heaven s name said i firing in spite of myself what does it matter to you where i am going leave that teapot alone
<s> it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave pumblechook the opportunity he wanted
<s> yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot alone
<s> you are right young man
<s> for once you are right
<s> i forgit myself when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers
<s> and yet said pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at arm s length this is him as i ever sported with in his days of happy infancy tell me not it cannot be i tell you this is him
<s> a low murmur from the two replied
<s> the waiter appeared to be particularly affected
<s> this is him said pumblechook as i have rode in my shay cart
<s> this is him as i have seen brought up by hand
<s> this is him untoe the sister of which i was uncle by marriage as her name was georgiana m ria from her own mother let him deny it if he can
<s> the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave the case a black look
<s> young man said pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old fashion you air a going to joseph
<s> what does it matter to me you ask me where you air a going i say to you sir you air a going to joseph
<s> the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that
<s> now said pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph
<s> here is squires of the boar present known and respected in this town and here is william which his father s name was potkins if i do not deceive myself
<s> you do not sir said william
<s> in their presence pursued pumblechook i will tell you young man what to say to joseph
<s> says you joseph i have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun s
<s> i will name no names joseph but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have seen that man
<s> i swear i don t see him here said i
<s> say that likewise retorted pumblechook
<s> say you said that and even joseph will probably betray surprise
<s> there you quite mistake him said i
<s> i know better
<s> says you pumblechook went on joseph i have seen that man and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice
<s> he knows your character joseph and is well acquainted with your pig headedness and ignorance and he knows my character joseph and he knows my want of gratitoode
<s> yes joseph says you here pumblechook shook his head and hand at me he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode
<s> he knows it joseph as none can
<s> you do not know it joseph having no call to know it but that man do
<s> windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine
<s> says you joseph he gave me a little message which i will now repeat
<s> it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of providence
<s> he knowed that finger when he saw joseph and he saw it plain
<s> it pinted out this writing joseph
<s> reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor and founder of fortun s
<s> but that man said he did not repent of what he had done joseph
<s> not at all
<s> it was right to do it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it again
<s> it s pity said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted breakfast that the man did not say what he had done and would do again
<s> squires of the boar pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and william i have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it again
<s> with those words the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite it
<s> i was not long after him in leaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as i passed on the opposite side of the way
<s> but it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to joe whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be contrasted with this brazen pretender
<s> i went towards them slowly for my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind
<s> the june weather was delicious
<s> the sky was blue the larks were soaring high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet
<s> many pleasant pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the change for the better that would come over my character when i had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom i had proved beguiled my way
<s> they awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened by my return and such a change had come to pass that i felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings had lasted many years
<s> the schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen but the little roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietness sake took me past it
<s> i was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday no children were there and biddy s house was closed
<s> some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated
<s> but the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it under the sweet green limes listening for the clink of joe s hammer
<s> long after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i heard it and found it but a fancy all was still
<s> the limes were there and the white thorns were there and the chestnut trees were there and their leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen but the clink of joe s hammer was not in the midsummer wind
<s> almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i saw it at last and saw that it was closed
<s> no gleam of fire no glittering shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and still
<s> but the house was not deserted and the best parlour seemed to be in use for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window was open and gay with flowers
<s> i went softly towards it meaning to peep over the flowers when joe and biddy stood before me arm in arm
<s> at first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but in another moment she was in my embrace
<s> i wept to see her and she wept to see me i because she looked so fresh and pleasant she because i looked so worn and white
<s> but dear biddy how smart you are
<s> yes dear pip
<s> and joe how smart you are
<s> yes dear old pip old chap
<s> i looked at both of them from one to the other and then
<s> it s my wedding day cried biddy in a burst of happiness and i am married to joe
<s> they had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on the old deal table
<s> biddy held one of my hands to her lips and joe s restoring touch was on my shoulder
<s> which he warn t strong enough my dear fur to be surprised said joe
<s> and biddy said i ought to have thought of it dear joe but i was too happy
<s> they were both so overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to them so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their day complete
<s> my first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never breathed this last baffled hope to joe
<s> how often while he was with me in my illness had it risen to my lips how irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour
<s> dear biddy said i you have the best husband in the whole world and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have but no you couldn t love him better than you do
<s> no i couldn t indeed said biddy
<s> and dear joe you have the best wife in the whole world and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble joe
<s> joe looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes
<s> and joe and biddy both as you have been to church to day and are in charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me and all i have so ill repaid and when i say that i am going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i shall never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison and have sent it to you don t think dear joe and biddy that if i could repay it a thousand times over i suppose i could cancel a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if i could
<s> they were both melted by these words and both entreated me to say no more
<s> but i must say more
<s> dear joe i hope you will have children to love and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of a winter night who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever
<s> don t tell him joe that i was thankless don t tell him biddy that i was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that i honoured you both because you were both so good and true and that as your child i said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i did
<s> i ain t a going said joe from behind his sleeve to tell him nothink o that natur pip
<s> nor biddy ain t
<s> nor yet no one ain t
<s> and now though i know you have already done it in your own kind hearts pray tell me both that you forgive me pray let me hear you say the words that i may carry the sound of them away with me and then i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of me in the time to come
<s> o dear old pip old chap said joe
<s> god knows as i forgive you if i have anythink to forgive
<s> amen and god knows i do echoed biddy
<s> now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few minutes by myself
<s> and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go with me as far as the finger post dear joe and biddy before we say good bye
<s> i sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition with my creditors who gave me ample time to pay them in full and i went out and joined herbert
<s> within a month i had quitted england and within two months i was clerk to clarriker and co
<s> and within four months i assumed my first undivided responsibility
<s> for the beam across the parlour ceiling at mill pond bank had then ceased to tremble under old bill barley s growls and was at peace and herbert had gone away to marry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until he brought her back
<s> many a year went round before i was a partner in the house but i lived happily with herbert and his wife and lived frugally and paid my debts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and joe
<s> it was not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to herbert but he then declared that the secret of herbert s partnership had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it
<s> so he told it and herbert was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow and i were not the worse friends for the long concealment
<s> i must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we made mints of money
<s> we were not in a grand way of business but we had a good name and worked for our profits and did very well
<s> we owed so much to herbert s ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often wondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all but had been in me
<s> chapter lix
<s> for eleven years i had not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily eyes though they had both been often before my fancy in the east when upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark i laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door
<s> i touched it so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen
<s> there smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as ever though a little grey sat joe and there fenced into the corner with joe s leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire was i again
<s> we giv him the name of pip for your sake dear old chap said joe delighted when i took another stool by the child s side but i did not rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and we think he do
<s> i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we talked immensely understanding one another to perfection
<s> and i took him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also georgiana wife of the above
<s> biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap you must give pip to me one of these days or lend him at all events
<s> no no said biddy gently
<s> you must marry
<s> so herbert and clara say but i don t think i shall biddy
<s> i have so settled down in their home that it s not at all likely
<s> i am already quite an old bachelor
<s> biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine
<s> there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddy s wedding ring that had a very pretty eloquence in it
<s> dear pip said biddy you are sure you don t fret for her
<s> o no i think not biddy
<s> tell me as an old old friend
<s> have you quite forgotten her
<s> my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there and little that ever had any place there
<s> but that poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddy all gone by
<s> nevertheless i knew while i said those words that i secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake
<s> yes even so
<s> for estella s sake
<s> i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality and meanness
<s> and i had heard of the death of her husband from an accident consequent on his ill treatment of a horse
<s> this release had befallen her some two years before for anything i knew she was married again
<s> the early dinner hour at joe s left me abundance of time without hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark
<s> but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times the day had quite declined when i came to the place
<s> there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the wall of the old garden
<s> the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin
<s> a gate in the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in
<s> a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet up to scatter it
<s> but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the moon was coming and the evening was not dark
<s> i could trace out where every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been and where the gates and where the casks
<s> i had done so and was looking along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it
<s> the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced
<s> it had been moving towards me but it stood still
<s> as i drew nearer i saw it to be the figure of a woman
<s> as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when it stopped and let me come up with it
<s> then it faltered as if much surprised and uttered my name and i cried out
<s> estella
<s> i am greatly changed
<s> i wonder you know me
<s> the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained
<s> those attractions in it i had seen before what i had never seen before was the saddened softened light of the once proud eyes what i had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand
<s> we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many years it is strange that we should thus meet again estella here where our first meeting was do you often come back
<s> i have never been here since
<s> nor i
<s> the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white ceiling which had passed away
<s> the moon began to rise and i thought of the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last words he had heard on earth
<s> estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us
<s> i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been prevented by many circumstances
<s> poor poor old place
<s> the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes
<s> not knowing that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said quietly
<s> were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this condition
<s> yes estella
<s> the ground belongs to me
<s> it is the only possession i have not relinquished
<s> everything else has gone from me little by little but i have kept this
<s> it was the subject of the only determined resistance i made in all the wretched years
<s> is it to be built on
<s> at last it is
<s> i came here to take leave of it before its change
<s> and you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer you live abroad still
<s> still
<s> and do well i am sure
<s> i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and therefore yes i do well
<s> i have often thought of you said estella
<s> have you
<s> of late very often
<s> there was a long hard time when i kept far from me the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant of its worth
<s> but since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart
<s> you have always held your place in my heart i answered
<s> and we were silent again until she spoke
<s> i little thought said estella that i should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot
<s> i am very glad to do so
<s> glad to part again estella to me parting is a painful thing
<s> to me the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful
<s> but you said to me returned estella very earnestly god bless you god forgive you and if you could say that to me then you will not hesitate to say that to me now now when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be
<s> i have been bent and broken but i hope into a better shape
<s> be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are friends
<s> we are friends said i rising and bending over her as she rose from the bench
<s> and will continue friends apart said estella
<s> i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her

<s> down the rabbit hole
<s> alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations
<s> so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
<s> there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge
<s> in another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out again
<s> the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well
<s> either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next
<s> first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs
<s> she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it
<s> well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they ll all think me at home why i wouldn t say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true
<s> down down down
<s> would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles i ve fallen by this time she said aloud
<s> i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth
<s> let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes that s about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say
<s> presently she began again
<s> i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know
<s> please ma am is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you re falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking no it ll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere
<s> down down down
<s> there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again
<s> dinah ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat
<s> i hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at tea time
<s> dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air i m afraid but you might catch a bat and that s very like a mouse you know
<s> but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldn t answer either question it didn t much matter which way she put it
<s> she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over
<s> alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it
<s> there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof
<s> there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again
<s> suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them
<s> however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted
<s> alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
<s> how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders
<s> oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin
<s> for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible
<s> there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters
<s> it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry
<s> no i ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later
<s> however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off
<s> what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope
<s> and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden
<s> first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle
<s> i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing
<s> after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried
<s> come there s no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people
<s> but it s no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person
<s> soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants
<s> well i ll eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t care which happens
<s> she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way
<s> so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake
<s> chapter ii
<s> the pool of tears
<s> curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was good bye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off
<s> oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears i m sure i shan t be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they won t walk the way i want to go let me see i ll give them a new pair of boots every christmas
<s> and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
<s> they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny it ll seem sending presents to one s own feet and how odd the directions will look
<s> alice s right foot esq
<s> hearthrug
<s> near the fender
<s> with alice s love
<s> oh dear what nonsense i m talking
<s> just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door
<s> poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry again
<s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall
<s> after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
<s> it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be savage if i ve kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go
<s> alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and yesterday things went on just as usual
<s> i wonder if i ve been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different
<s> but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah that s the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them
<s> i m sure i m not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all and i m sure i can t be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides she s she and i m i and oh dear how puzzling it all is i ll try if i know all the things i used to know
<s> let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesn t signify let s try geography
<s> london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and rome no that s all wrong i m certain i must have been changed for mabel i ll try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do
<s> how doth the little crocodile
<s> improve his shining tail
<s> and pour the waters of the nile
<s> on every golden scale
<s> how cheerfully he seems to grin
<s> how neatly spread his claws
<s> and welcome little fishes in
<s> with gently smiling jaws
<s> i m sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no i ve made up my mind about it if i m mabel i ll stay down here it ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person i ll come up if not i ll stay down here till i m somebody else but oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here
<s> as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking
<s> how can i have done that she thought
<s> i must be growing small again
<s> she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether
<s> that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare it s too bad that it is
<s> as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water
<s> her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself
<s> alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station
<s> however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high
<s> i wish i hadn t cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out
<s> i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer to day
<s> just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
<s> would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in trying
<s> so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing
<s> perhaps it doesn t understand english thought alice i daresay it s a french mouse come over with william the conqueror
<s> for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened
<s> so she began again où est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lesson book
<s> the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright
<s> oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings
<s> i quite forgot you didn t like cats
<s> not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice
<s> would you like cats if you were me
<s> well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it
<s> and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
<s> she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended
<s> we won t talk about her any more if you d rather not
<s> we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail
<s> as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things don t let me hear the name again
<s> i won t indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation
<s> are you are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and it ll fetch things when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went
<s> so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs
<s> it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures
<s> alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore
<s> chapter iii
<s> a caucus race and a long tale
<s> they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortable
<s> the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life
<s> indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said
<s> at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle
<s> alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon
<s> ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know
<s> silence all round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
<s> edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria
<s> ugh said the lory with a shiver
<s> i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speak
<s> not i said the lory hastily
<s> i thought you did said the mouse
<s> i proceed
<s> edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisable
<s> found what said the duck
<s> found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means
<s> i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a worm
<s> the question is what did the archbishop find
<s> the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown
<s> william s conduct at first was moderate
<s> but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke
<s> as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all
<s> in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies
<s> speak english said the eaglet
<s> i don t know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you do either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly
<s> what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race
<s> what is a caucus race said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything
<s> why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
<s> and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed it
<s> first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle the exact shape doesn t matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there
<s> there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over
<s> however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won
<s> this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence
<s> at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes
<s> but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked
<s> why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizes
<s> alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
<s> there was exactly one a piece all round
<s> but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse
<s> of course the dodo replied very gravely
<s> what else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice
<s> only a thimble said alice sadly
<s> hand it over here said the dodo
<s> then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered
<s> alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could
<s> the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back
<s> however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more
<s> you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again
<s> mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighing
<s> it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this
<s> fury said to a
<s> mouse that he
<s> met in the
<s> house
<s> let us
<s> both go to
<s> law i will
<s> prosecute
<s> you
<s> come
<s> i ll take no
<s> denial we
<s> must have a
<s> trial for
<s> really this
<s> morning i ve
<s> nothing
<s> to do
<s> said the
<s> mouse to the
<s> cur such
<s> a trial
<s> dear sir
<s> with
<s> no jury
<s> or judge
<s> would be
<s> wasting
<s> our
<s> breath
<s> i ll be
<s> judge i ll
<s> be jury
<s> said
<s> cunning
<s> old fury
<s> i ll
<s> try the
<s> whole
<s> cause
<s> and
<s> condemn
<s> you
<s> to
<s> death
<s> you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely
<s> what are you thinking of
<s> i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i think
<s> i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily
<s> a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her
<s> oh do let me help to undo it
<s> i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away
<s> you insult me by talking such nonsense
<s> i didn t mean it pleaded poor alice
<s> but you re so easily offended you know
<s> the mouse only growled in reply
<s> please come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker
<s> what a pity it wouldn t stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly
<s> you re enough to try the patience of an oyster
<s> i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular
<s> she d soon fetch it back
<s> and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the lory
<s> alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinah s our cat
<s> and she s such a capital one for catching mice you can t think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it
<s> this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
<s> some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the night air doesn t suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone
<s> i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone
<s> nobody seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited
<s> in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story
<s> chapter iv
<s> the rabbit sends in a little bill
<s> it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely
<s> very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made
<s> he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran
<s> how surprised he ll be when he finds out who i am but i d better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them
<s> as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w
<s> rabbit engraved upon it
<s> she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves
<s> how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinah ll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but i ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out
<s> only i don t think alice went on that they d let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that
<s> by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass
<s> there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips
<s> i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so i ll just see what this bottle does
<s> i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
<s> it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken
<s> she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself that s quite enough i hope i shan t grow any more as it is i can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn t drunk quite so much
<s> alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head
<s> still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens
<s> what will become of me
<s> luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy
<s> it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasn t always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits
<s> i almost wish i hadn t gone down that rabbit hole and yet and yet it s rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up i ll write one but i m grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least there s no room to grow up any more here
<s> but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now that ll be a comfort one way never to be an old woman but then always to have lessons to learn oh i shouldn t like that
<s> oh you foolish alice she answered herself
<s> how can you learn lessons in here why there s hardly room for you and no room at all for any lesson books
<s> and so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen
<s> mary ann mary ann said the voice
<s> fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs
<s> alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it
<s> presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure
<s> alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in at the window
<s> that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air
<s> she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber frame or something of the sort
<s> next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for apples yer honour
<s> digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily
<s> here come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass
<s> now tell me pat what s that in the window
<s> sure it s an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum
<s> an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole window
<s> sure it does yer honour but it s an arm for all that
<s> well it s got no business there at any rate go and take it away
<s> there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i don t like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air
<s> this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass
<s> what a number of cucumber frames there must be thought alice
<s> i wonder what they ll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could i m sure i don t want to stay in here any longer
<s> she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words where s the other ladder why i hadn t to bring but one bill s got the other bill fetch it here lad here put em up at this corner no tie em together first they don t reach half high enough yet oh they ll do well enough don t be particular here bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it s coming down heads below a loud crash now who did that it was bill i fancy who s to go down the chimney nay i shan t you do it that i won t then bill s to go down here bill the master says you re to go down the chimney
<s> oh so bill s got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself
<s> shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldn t be in bill s place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little
<s> she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next
<s> the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice along catch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy now don t choke him how was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it
<s> last came a little feeble squeaking voice that s bill thought alice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m better now but i m a deal too flustered to tell you all i know is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes like a sky rocket
<s> so you did old fellow said the others
<s> we must burn the house down said the rabbit s voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do i ll set dinah at you
<s> there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense they d take the roof off
<s> after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with
<s> a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
<s> i ll put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out you d better not do that again which produced another dead silence
<s> alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head
<s> if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose
<s> so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly
<s> as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
<s> the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
<s> they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood
<s> the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
<s> i think that will be the best plan
<s> it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry
<s> an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
<s> poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
<s> hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut
<s> this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance
<s> and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much if if i d only been the right size to do it oh dear i d nearly forgotten that i ve got to grow up again let me see how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what
<s> the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances
<s> there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
<s> she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else
<s> chapter v
<s> advice from a caterpillar
<s> the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice
<s> who are you said the caterpillar
<s> this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation
<s> alice replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then
<s> what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly
<s> explain yourself
<s> i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice because i m not myself you see
<s> i don t see said the caterpillar
<s> i m afraid i can t put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i can t understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing
<s> it isn t said the caterpillar
<s> well perhaps you haven t found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you know and then after that into a butterfly i should think you ll feel it a little queer won t you
<s> not a bit said the caterpillar
<s> well perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to me
<s> you said the caterpillar contemptuously
<s> who are you
<s> which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation
<s> alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first
<s> why said the caterpillar
<s> here was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away
<s> come back the caterpillar called after her
<s> i ve something important to say
<s> this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again
<s> keep your temper said the caterpillar
<s> is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she could
<s> no said the caterpillar
<s> alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing
<s> for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you
<s> i m afraid i am sir said alice i can t remember things as i used and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together
<s> can t remember what things said the caterpillar
<s> well i ve tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice
<s> repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar
<s> alice folded her hands and began
<s> you are old father william the young man said
<s> and your hair has become very white
<s> and yet you incessantly stand on your head
<s> do you think at your age it is right
<s> in my youth father william replied to his son
<s> i feared it might injure the brain
<s> but now that i m perfectly sure i have none
<s> why i do it again and again
<s> you are old said the youth as i mentioned before
<s> and have grown most uncommonly fat
<s> yet you turned a back somersault in at the door
<s> pray what is the reason of that
<s> in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks
<s> i kept all my limbs very supple
<s> by the use of this ointment one shilling the box
<s> allow me to sell you a couple
<s> you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
<s> for anything tougher than suet
<s> yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak
<s> pray how did you manage to do it
<s> in my youth said his father i took to the law
<s> and argued each case with my wife
<s> and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
<s> has lasted the rest of my life
<s> you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
<s> that your eye was as steady as ever
<s> yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
<s> what made you so awfully clever
<s> i have answered three questions and that is enough
<s> said his father don t give yourself airs
<s> do you think i can listen all day to such stuff
<s> be off or i ll kick you down stairs
<s> that is not said right said the caterpillar
<s> not quite right i m afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered
<s> it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutes
<s> the caterpillar was the first to speak
<s> what size do you want to be it asked
<s> oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesn t like changing so often you know
<s> i don t know said the caterpillar
<s> alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper
<s> are you content now said the caterpillar
<s> well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be
<s> it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high
<s> but i m not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone
<s> and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended
<s> you ll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again
<s> this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
<s> in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself
<s> then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter
<s> one side of what the other side of what thought alice to herself
<s> of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight
<s> alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
<s> however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
<s> and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her foot
<s> she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
<s> her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
<s> come my head s free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her
<s> what can all that green stuff be said alice
<s> and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves
<s> as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent
<s> she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings
<s> serpent screamed the pigeon
<s> i m not a serpent said alice indignantly
<s> let me alone
<s> serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob i ve tried every way and nothing seems to suit them
<s> i haven t the least idea what you re talking about said alice
<s> i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents there s no pleasing them
<s> alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
<s> as if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day why i haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks
<s> i m very sorry you ve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning
<s> and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent
<s> but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice
<s> i m a i m a
<s> well what are you said the pigeon
<s> i can see you re trying to invent something
<s> i i m a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day
<s> a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt
<s> i ve seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no you re a serpent and there s no use denying it
<s> i suppose you ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg
<s> i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know
<s> i don t believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then they re a kind of serpent that s all i can say
<s> this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding you re looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent
<s> it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them raw
<s> well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest
<s> alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it
<s> after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
<s> it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual
<s> come there s half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are i m never sure what i m going to be from one minute to another however i ve got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high
<s> whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high
<s> chapter vi
<s> pig and pepper
<s> for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles
<s> it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads
<s> she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen
<s> the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess
<s> an invitation from the queen to play croquet
<s> the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen
<s> an invitation for the duchess to play croquet
<s> then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together
<s> alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky
<s> alice went timidly up to the door and knocked
<s> there s no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons
<s> first because i m on the same side of the door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you
<s> and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces
<s> please then said alice how am i to get in
<s> there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us
<s> for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know
<s> he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil
<s> but perhaps he can t help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head
<s> but at any rate he might answer questions
<s> how am i to get in she repeated aloud
<s> i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow
<s> at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footman s head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him
<s> or next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happened
<s> how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone
<s> are you to get in at all said the footman
<s> that s the first question you know
<s> it was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so
<s> it s really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue
<s> it s enough to drive one crazy
<s> the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations
<s> i shall sit here he said on and off for days and days
<s> but what am i to do said alice
<s> anything you like said the footman and began whistling
<s> oh there s no use in talking to him said alice desperately he s perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in
<s> the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup
<s> there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing
<s> there was certainly too much of it in the air
<s> even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause
<s> the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear
<s> please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like that
<s> it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why
<s> pig
<s> she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on again
<s> i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could grin
<s> they all can said the duchess and most of em do
<s> i don t know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation
<s> you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact
<s> alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation
<s> while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes
<s> the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
<s> oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror
<s> oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off
<s> if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it does
<s> which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge
<s> just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twenty four hours to turn round on its axis
<s> talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head
<s> alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four hours i think or is it twelve i
<s> oh don t bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line
<s> speak roughly to your little boy
<s> and beat him when he sneezes
<s> he only does it to annoy
<s> because he knows it teases
<s> chorus
<s> in which the cook and the baby joined
<s> wow wow wow
<s> while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the words
<s> i speak severely to my boy
<s> i beat him when he sneezes
<s> for he can thoroughly enjoy
<s> the pepper when he pleases
<s> chorus
<s> wow wow wow
<s> here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke
<s> i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room
<s> the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out but it just missed her
<s> alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a star fish thought alice
<s> the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it
<s> as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air
<s> if i don t take this child away with me thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time
<s> don t grunt said alice that s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself
<s> the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it
<s> there could be no doubt that it had a very turn up nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all
<s> but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears
<s> no there were no tears
<s> if you re going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously i ll have nothing more to do with you
<s> mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence
<s> alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm
<s> this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further
<s> so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood
<s> if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think
<s> and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off
<s> the cat only grinned when it saw alice
<s> it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
<s> cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider
<s> come it s pleased so far thought alice and she went on
<s> would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
<s> that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cat
<s> i don t much care where said alice
<s> then it doesn t matter which way you go said the cat
<s> so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation
<s> oh you re sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enough
<s> alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question
<s> what sort of people live about here
<s> in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare
<s> visit either you like they re both mad
<s> but i don t want to go among mad people alice remarked
<s> oh you can t help that said the cat we re all mad here
<s> i m mad
<s> you re mad
<s> how do you know i m mad said alice
<s> you must be said the cat or you wouldn t have come here
<s> alice didn t think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that you re mad
<s> to begin with said the cat a dog s not mad
<s> you grant that
<s> i suppose so said alice
<s> well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when it s angry and wags its tail when it s pleased
<s> now i growl when i m pleased and wag my tail when i m angry
<s> therefore i m mad
<s> i call it purring not growling said alice
<s> call it what you like said the cat
<s> do you play croquet with the queen to day
<s> i should like it very much said alice but i haven t been invited yet
<s> you ll see me there said the cat and vanished
<s> alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening
<s> while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared again
<s> by the bye what became of the baby said the cat
<s> i d nearly forgotten to ask
<s> it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural way
<s> i thought it would said the cat and vanished again
<s> alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live
<s> i ve seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as it was in march
<s> as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree
<s> did you say pig or fig said the cat
<s> i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldn t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy
<s> all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone
<s> well i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat it s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life
<s> she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur
<s> it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead
<s> chapter vii
<s> a mad tea party
<s> there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head
<s> very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as it s asleep i suppose it doesn t mind
<s> the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming
<s> there s plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the table
<s> have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone
<s> alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea
<s> i don t see any wine she remarked
<s> there isn t any said the march hare
<s> then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it said alice angrily
<s> it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare
<s> i didn t know it was your table said alice it s laid for a great many more than three
<s> your hair wants cutting said the hatter
<s> he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speech
<s> you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity it s very rude
<s> the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk
<s> come we shall have some fun now thought alice
<s> i m glad they ve begun asking riddles
<s> i believe i can guess that she added aloud
<s> do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare
<s> exactly so said alice
<s> then you should say what you mean the march hare went on
<s> i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know
<s> not the same thing a bit said the hatter
<s> you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see
<s> you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like
<s> you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe
<s> it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing desks which wasn t much
<s> the hatter was the first to break the silence
<s> what day of the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear
<s> alice considered a little and then said the fourth
<s> two days wrong sighed the hatter
<s> i told you butter wouldn t suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hare
<s> it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied
<s> yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldn t have put it in with the bread knife
<s> the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know
<s> alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
<s> what a funny watch she remarked
<s> it tells the day of the month and doesn t tell what o clock it is
<s> why should it muttered the hatter
<s> does your watch tell you what year it is
<s> of course not alice replied very readily but that s because it stays the same year for such a long time together
<s> which is just the case with mine said the hatter
<s> alice felt dreadfully puzzled
<s> the hatter s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english
<s> i don t quite understand you she said as politely as she could
<s> the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose
<s> the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myself
<s> have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice again
<s> no i give it up alice replied what s the answer
<s> i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter
<s> nor i said the march hare
<s> alice sighed wearily
<s> i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers
<s> if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldn t talk about wasting it
<s> it s him
<s> i don t know what you mean said alice
<s> of course you don t the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously
<s> i dare say you never even spoke to time
<s> perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn music
<s> ah that accounts for it said the hatter
<s> he won t stand beating
<s> now if you only kept on good terms with him he d do almost anything you liked with the clock
<s> for instance suppose it were nine o clock in the morning just time to begin lessons you d only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner
<s> i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper
<s> that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but then i shouldn t be hungry for it you know
<s> not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked
<s> is that the way you manage alice asked
<s> the hatter shook his head mournfully
<s> not i he replied
<s> we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing
<s> twinkle twinkle little bat
<s> how i wonder what you re at
<s> you know the song perhaps
<s> i ve heard something like it said alice
<s> it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way
<s> up above the world you fly
<s> like a tea tray in the sky
<s> twinkle twinkle
<s> here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop
<s> well i d hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out he s murdering the time off with his head
<s> how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice
<s> and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he won t do a thing i ask it s always six o clock now
<s> a bright idea came into alice s head
<s> is that the reason so many tea things are put out here she asked
<s> yes that s it said the hatter with a sigh it s always tea time and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles
<s> then you keep moving round i suppose said alice
<s> exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up
<s> but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to ask
<s> suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning
<s> i m getting tired of this
<s> i vote the young lady tells us a story
<s> i m afraid i don t know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal
<s> then the dormouse shall they both cried
<s> wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once
<s> the dormouse slowly opened his eyes
<s> i wasn t asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were saying
<s> tell us a story said the march hare
<s> yes please do pleaded alice
<s> and be quick about it added the hatter or you ll be asleep again before it s done
<s> once upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well
<s> what did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking
<s> they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two
<s> they couldn t have done that you know alice gently remarked they d have been ill
<s> so they were said the dormouse very ill
<s> alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a well
<s> take some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestly
<s> i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t take more
<s> you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take more than nothing
<s> nobody asked your opinion said alice
<s> who s making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantly
<s> alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question
<s> why did they live at the bottom of a well
<s> the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treacle well
<s> there s no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you can t be civil you d better finish the story for yourself
<s> no please go on alice said very humbly i won t interrupt again
<s> i dare say there may be one
<s> one indeed said the dormouse indignantly
<s> however he consented to go on
<s> and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw you know
<s> what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise
<s> treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this time
<s> i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter let s all move one place on
<s> he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouse s place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare
<s> the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milk jug into his plate
<s> alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i don t understand
<s> where did they draw the treacle from
<s> you can draw water out of a water well said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh stupid
<s> but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remark
<s> of course they were said the dormouse well in
<s> this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it
<s> they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of things everything that begins with an m
<s> why with an m said alice
<s> why not said the march hare
<s> alice was silent
<s> the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness
<s> really now you ask me said alice very much confused i don t think
<s> then you shouldn t talk said the hatter
<s> this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot
<s> at any rate i ll never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood
<s> it s the stupidest tea party i ever was at in all my life
<s> just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it
<s> that s very curious she thought
<s> but everything s curious today
<s> i think i may as well go in at once
<s> and in she went
<s> once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table
<s> now i ll manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden
<s> then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains
<s> chapter viii
<s> the queen s croquet ground
<s> a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red
<s> alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five don t go splashing paint over me like that
<s> i couldn t help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbow
<s> on which seven looked up and said that s right five always lay the blame on others
<s> you d better not talk said five
<s> i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded
<s> what for said the one who had spoken first
<s> that s none of your business two said seven
<s> yes it is his business said five and i ll tell him it was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions
<s> seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low
<s> would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses
<s> five and seven said nothing but looked at two
<s> two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know
<s> so you see miss we re doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces
<s> there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen
<s> first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did
<s> after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts
<s> next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her
<s> then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts
<s> alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldn t see it so she stood still where she was and waited
<s> when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply
<s> idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on what s your name child
<s> my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why they re only a pack of cards after all
<s> i needn t be afraid of them
<s> and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose tree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children
<s> how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage
<s> it s no business of mine
<s> the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off
<s> nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silent
<s> the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a child
<s> the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over
<s> the knave did so very carefully with one foot
<s> get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody else
<s> leave off that screamed the queen
<s> you make me giddy
<s> and then turning to the rose tree she went on what have you been doing here
<s> may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying
<s> i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses
<s> off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection
<s> you shan t be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flower pot that stood near
<s> the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others
<s> are their heads off shouted the queen
<s> their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted in reply
<s> that s right shouted the queen
<s> can you play croquet
<s> the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for her
<s> yes shouted alice
<s> come on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen next
<s> it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
<s> she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face
<s> very said alice where s the duchess
<s> hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone
<s> he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered she s under sentence of execution
<s> what for said alice
<s> did you say what a pity the rabbit asked
<s> no i didn t said alice i don t think it s at all a pity
<s> i said what for
<s> she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began
<s> alice gave a little scream of laughter
<s> oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone
<s> the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen said
<s> get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began
<s> alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches
<s> the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed
<s> the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute
<s> alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me they re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that there s any one left alive
<s> she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself it s the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to
<s> how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with
<s> alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded
<s> it s no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them
<s> in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her
<s> the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared
<s> i don t think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance there s the arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground and i should have croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming
<s> how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice
<s> not at all said alice she s so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that it s hardly worth while finishing the game
<s> the queen smiled and passed on
<s> who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cat s head with great curiosity
<s> it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce it
<s> i don t like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likes
<s> i d rather not the cat remarked
<s> don t be impertinent said the king and don t look at me like that he got behind alice as he spoke
<s> a cat may look at a king said alice
<s> i ve read that in some book but i don t remember where
<s> well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would have this cat removed
<s> the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small
<s> off with his head she said without even looking round
<s> i ll fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried off
<s> alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queen s voice in the distance screaming with passion
<s> she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not
<s> so she went in search of her hedgehog
<s> the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree
<s> by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesn t matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground
<s> so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend
<s> when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable
<s> the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said
<s> the executioner s argument was that you couldn t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life
<s> the king s argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you weren t to talk nonsense
<s> the queen s argument was that if something wasn t done about it in less than no time she d have everybody executed all round
<s> it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious
<s> alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess you d better ask her about it
<s> she s in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here
<s> and the executioner went off like an arrow
<s> the cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game
<s> chapter ix
<s> the mock turtle s story
<s> you can t think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s and they walked off together
<s> alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen
<s> when i m a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all
<s> soup does very well without maybe it s always pepper that makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar and such things that make children sweet tempered
<s> i only wish people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it you know
<s> she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
<s> you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk
<s> i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit
<s> perhaps it hasn t one alice ventured to remark
<s> tut tut child said the duchess
<s> everything s got a moral if only you can find it
<s> and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as she spoke
<s> alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin
<s> however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could
<s> the game s going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a little
<s> tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round
<s> somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding their own business
<s> ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added and the moral of that is take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves
<s> how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herself
<s> i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that i m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo
<s> shall i try the experiment
<s> he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried
<s> very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite
<s> and the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together
<s> only mustard isn t a bird alice remarked
<s> right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting things
<s> it s a mineral i think said alice
<s> of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said there s a large mustard mine near here
<s> and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the less there is of yours
<s> oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark it s a vegetable
<s> it doesn t look like one but it is
<s> i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that is be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise
<s> i think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i can t quite follow it as you say it
<s> that s nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone
<s> pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said alice
<s> oh don t talk about trouble said the duchess
<s> i make you a present of everything i ve said as yet
<s> a cheap sort of present thought alice
<s> i m glad they don t give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out loud
<s> thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin
<s> i ve a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worried
<s> just about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the m
<s> but here to alice s great surprise the duchess s voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble
<s> alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm
<s> a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voice
<s> now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice
<s> the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment
<s> let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground
<s> the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moment s delay would cost them their lives
<s> all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution
<s> then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet
<s> no said alice
<s> i don t even know what a mock turtle is
<s> it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen
<s> i never saw one or heard of one said alice
<s> come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history
<s> as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned
<s> come that s a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered
<s> they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun
<s> if you don t know what a gryphon is look at the picture
<s> up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history
<s> i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon
<s> alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited
<s> the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled
<s> what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alice
<s> what is the fun said alice
<s> why she said the gryphon
<s> it s all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know
<s> come on
<s> everybody says come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life never
<s> they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break
<s> she pitied him deeply
<s> what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before it s all his fancy that he hasn t got no sorrow you know
<s> come on
<s> so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing
<s> this here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she do
<s> i ll tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and don t speak a word till i ve finished
<s> so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes
<s> alice thought to herself i don t see how he can ever finish if he doesn t begin
<s> but she waited patiently
<s> once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtle
<s> these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle
<s> alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing
<s> when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea
<s> the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise
<s> why did you call him tortoise if he wasn t one alice asked
<s> we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dull
<s> you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth
<s> at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow don t be all day about it and he went on in these words
<s> yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn t believe it
<s> i never said i didn t interrupted alice
<s> you did said the mock turtle
<s> hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again
<s> the mock turtle went on
<s> we had the best of educations in fact we went to school every day
<s> i ve been to a day school too said alice you needn t be so proud as all that
<s> with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously
<s> yes said alice we learned french and music
<s> and washing said the mock turtle
<s> certainly not said alice indignantly
<s> ah then yours wasn t a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief
<s> now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washing extra
<s> you couldn t have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the sea
<s> i couldn t afford to learn it
<s> said the mock turtle with a sigh
<s> i only took the regular course
<s> what was that inquired alice
<s> reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derision
<s> i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say
<s> what is it
<s> the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise
<s> what never heard of uglifying it exclaimed
<s> you know what to beautify is i suppose
<s> yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier
<s> well then the gryphon went on if you don t know what to uglify is you are a simpleton
<s> alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learn
<s> well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils
<s> what was that like said alice
<s> well i can t show it you myself the mock turtle said i m too stiff
<s> and the gryphon never learnt it
<s> hadn t time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though
<s> he was an old crab he was
<s> i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to say
<s> so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their paws
<s> and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subject
<s> ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so on
<s> what a curious plan exclaimed alice
<s> that s the reason they re called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to day
<s> this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark
<s> then the eleventh day must have been a holiday
<s> of course it was said the mock turtle
<s> and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly
<s> that s enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now
<s> chapter x
<s> the lobster quadrille
<s> the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes
<s> he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice
<s> same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back
<s> at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again
<s> you may not have lived much under the sea i haven t said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is
<s> no indeed said alice
<s> what sort of a dance is it
<s> why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore
<s> two lines cried the mock turtle
<s> seals turtles salmon and so on then when you ve cleared all the jelly fish out of the way
<s> that generally takes some time interrupted the gryphon
<s> you advance twice
<s> each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon
<s> of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partners
<s> change lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphon
<s> then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the
<s> the lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the air
<s> as far out to sea as you can
<s> swim after them screamed the gryphon
<s> turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly about
<s> change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice
<s> back to land again and that s all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice
<s> it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly
<s> would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle
<s> very much indeed said alice
<s> come let s try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon
<s> we can do without lobsters you know
<s> which shall sing
<s> oh you sing said the gryphon
<s> i ve forgotten the words
<s> so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly
<s> will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail
<s> there s a porpoise close behind us and he s treading on my tail
<s> see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
<s> they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance
<s> will you won t you will you won t you will you join the dance
<s> will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the dance
<s> you can really have no notion how delightful it will be
<s> when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea
<s> but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance
<s> said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance
<s> would not could not would not could not would not join the dance
<s> would not could not would not could not could not join the dance
<s> what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied
<s> there is another shore you know upon the other side
<s> the further off from england the nearer is to france
<s> then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance
<s> will you won t you will you won t you will you join the dance
<s> will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the dance
<s> thank you it s a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting
<s> oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they you ve seen them of course
<s> yes said alice i ve often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastily
<s> i don t know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if you ve seen them so often of course you know what they re like
<s> i believe so alice replied thoughtfully
<s> they have their tails in their mouths and they re all over crumbs
<s> you re wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea
<s> but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes
<s> tell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon
<s> the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance
<s> so they got thrown out to sea
<s> so they had to fall a long way
<s> so they got their tails fast in their mouths
<s> so they couldn t get them out again
<s> that s all
<s> thank you said alice it s very interesting
<s> i never knew so much about a whiting before
<s> i can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon
<s> do you know why it s called a whiting
<s> i never thought about it said alice
<s> why
<s> it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnly
<s> alice was thoroughly puzzled
<s> does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tone
<s> why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon
<s> i mean what makes them so shiny
<s> alice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer
<s> they re done with blacking i believe
<s> boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting
<s> now you know
<s> and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiosity
<s> soles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you that
<s> if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song i d have said to the porpoise keep back please we don t want you with us
<s> they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
<s> wouldn t it really said alice in a tone of great surprise
<s> of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoise
<s> don t you mean purpose said alice
<s> i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone
<s> and the gryphon added come let s hear some of your adventures
<s> i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but it s no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then
<s> explain all that said the mock turtle
<s> no no the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time
<s> so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit
<s> she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on
<s> her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that s very curious
<s> it s all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon
<s> it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully
<s> i should like to hear her try and repeat something now
<s> tell her to begin
<s> he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice
<s> stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphon
<s> how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once
<s> however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed
<s> tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare
<s> you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair
<s> as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose
<s> trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes
<s> later editions continued as follows
<s> when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark
<s> and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark
<s> but when the tide rises and sharks are around
<s> his voice has a timid and tremulous sound
<s> that s different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphon
<s> well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense
<s> alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again
<s> i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle
<s> she can t explain it said the gryphon hastily
<s> go on with the next verse
<s> but about his toes the mock turtle persisted
<s> how could he turn them out with his nose you know
<s> it s the first position in dancing
<s> alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subject
<s> go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden
<s> alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice
<s> i passed by his garden and marked with one eye
<s> how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie
<s> later editions continued as follows
<s> the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat
<s> while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat
<s> when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon
<s> was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon
<s> while the panther received knife and fork with a growl
<s> and concluded the banquet
<s> what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on it s by far the most confusing thing i ever heard
<s> yes i think you d better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do so
<s> shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on
<s> or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song
<s> oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her turtle soup will you old fellow
<s> the mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing this
<s> beautiful soup so rich and green
<s> waiting in a hot tureen
<s> who for such dainties would not stoop
<s> soup of the evening beautiful soup
<s> soup of the evening beautiful soup
<s> beau ootiful soo oop
<s> beau ootiful soo oop
<s> soo oop of the e e evening
<s> beautiful beautiful soup
<s> beautiful soup who cares for fish
<s> game or any other dish
<s> who would not give all else for two p
<s> ennyworth only of beautiful soup
<s> pennyworth only of beautiful soup
<s> beau ootiful soo oop
<s> beau ootiful soo oop
<s> soo oop of the e e evening
<s> beautiful beauti ful soup
<s> chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial s beginning was heard in the distance
<s> come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song
<s> what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy words
<s> soo oop of the e e evening
<s> beautiful beautiful soup
<s> chapter xi
<s> who stole the tarts
<s> the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other
<s> in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish they d get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time
<s> alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there
<s> that s the judge she said to herself because of his great wig
<s> the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming
<s> and that s the jury box thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors
<s> she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all
<s> however jury men would have done just as well
<s> the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
<s> what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon
<s> they can t have anything to put down yet before the trial s begun
<s> they re putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial
<s> stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking
<s> alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him
<s> a nice muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over thought alice
<s> one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked
<s> this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away
<s> she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate
<s> herald read the accusation said the king
<s> on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows
<s> the queen of hearts she made some tarts
<s> all on a summer day
<s> the knave of hearts he stole those tarts
<s> and took them quite away
<s> consider your verdict the king said to the jury
<s> not yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted
<s> there s a great deal to come before that
<s> call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witness
<s> the first witness was the hatter
<s> he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other
<s> i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadn t quite finished my tea when i was sent for
<s> you ought to have finished said the king
<s> when did you begin
<s> the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arm in arm with the dormouse
<s> fourteenth of march i think it was he said
<s> fifteenth said the march hare
<s> sixteenth added the dormouse
<s> write that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
<s> take off your hat the king said to the hatter
<s> it isn t mine said the hatter
<s> stolen the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the fact
<s> i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation i ve none of my own
<s> i m a hatter
<s> here the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgeted
<s> give your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on the spot
<s> this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter
<s> just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her
<s> i wish you wouldn t squeeze so
<s> said the dormouse who was sitting next to her
<s> i can hardly breathe
<s> i can t help it said alice very meekly i m growing
<s> you ve no right to grow here said the dormouse
<s> don t talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know you re growing too
<s> yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion
<s> and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court
<s> all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off
<s> give your evidence the king repeated angrily or i ll have you executed whether you re nervous or not
<s> i m a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea
<s> the twinkling of the what said the king
<s> it began with the tea the hatter replied
<s> of course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply
<s> do you take me for a dunce go on
<s> i m a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after that only the march hare said
<s> i didn t the march hare interrupted in a great hurry
<s> you did said the hatter
<s> i deny it said the march hare
<s> he denies it said the king leave out that part
<s> well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep
<s> after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread and butter
<s> but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked
<s> that i can t remember said the hatter
<s> you must remember remarked the king or i ll have you executed
<s> the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee
<s> i m a poor man your majesty he began
<s> you re a very poor speaker said the king
<s> here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court
<s> as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done
<s> they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat upon it
<s> i m glad i ve seen that done thought alice
<s> i ve so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now
<s> if that s all you know about it you may stand down continued the king
<s> i can t go no lower said the hatter i m on the floor as it is
<s> then you may sit down the king replied
<s> here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed
<s> come that finished the guinea pigs thought alice
<s> now we shall get on better
<s> i d rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singers
<s> you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes on
<s> and just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door
<s> call the next witness said the king
<s> the next witness was the duchess s cook
<s> she carried the pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once
<s> give your evidence said the king
<s> shan t said the cook
<s> the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness
<s> well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made of
<s> pepper mostly said the cook
<s> treacle said a sleepy voice behind her
<s> collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out
<s> behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his whiskers
<s> for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared
<s> never mind said the king with an air of great relief
<s> call the next witness
<s> and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must cross examine the next witness
<s> it quite makes my forehead ache
<s> alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they haven t got much evidence yet she said to herself
<s> imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice
<s> chapter xii
<s> alice s evidence
<s> here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before
<s> oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury box or they would die
<s> the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said so
<s> alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move
<s> she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
<s> as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court
<s> what do you know about this business the king said to alice
<s> nothing said alice
<s> nothing whatever persisted the king
<s> nothing whatever said alice
<s> that s very important the king said turning to the jury
<s> they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke
<s> unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone
<s> important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying which word sounded best
<s> some of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant
<s> alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit she thought to herself
<s> at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence and read out from his book rule forty two
<s> all persons more than a mile high to leave the court
<s> everybody looked at alice
<s> i m not a mile high said alice
<s> you are said the king
<s> nearly two miles high added the queen
<s> well i shan t go at any rate said alice besides that s not a regular rule you invented it just now
<s> it s the oldest rule in the book said the king
<s> then it ought to be number one said alice
<s> the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily
<s> consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voice
<s> there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked up
<s> what s in it said the queen
<s> i haven t opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody
<s> it must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isn t usual you know
<s> who is it directed to said one of the jurymen
<s> it isn t directed at all said the white rabbit in fact there s nothing written on the outside
<s> he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a set of verses
<s> are they in the prisoner s handwriting asked another of the jurymen
<s> no they re not said the white rabbit and that s the queerest thing about it
<s> the jury all looked puzzled
<s> he must have imitated somebody else s hand said the king
<s> the jury all brightened up again
<s> please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and they can t prove i did there s no name signed at the end
<s> if you didn t sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse
<s> you must have meant some mischief or else you d have signed your name like an honest man
<s> there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day
<s> that proves his guilt said the queen
<s> it proves nothing of the sort said alice
<s> why you don t even know what they re about
<s> read them said the king
<s> the white rabbit put on his spectacles
<s> where shall i begin please your majesty he asked
<s> begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stop
<s> these were the verses the white rabbit read
<s> they told me you had been to her
<s> and mentioned me to him
<s> she gave me a good character
<s> but said i could not swim
<s> he sent them word i had not gone
<s> we know it to be true
<s> if she should push the matter on
<s> what would become of you
<s> i gave her one they gave him two
<s> you gave us three or more
<s> they all returned from him to you
<s> though they were mine before
<s> if i or she should chance to be
<s> involved in this affair
<s> he trusts to you to set them free
<s> exactly as we were
<s> my notion was that you had been
<s> before she had this fit
<s> an obstacle that came between
<s> him and ourselves and it
<s> don t let him know she liked them best
<s> for this must ever be
<s> a secret kept from all the rest
<s> between yourself and me
<s> that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury
<s> if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of interrupting him i ll give him sixpence
<s> i don t believe there s an atom of meaning in it
<s> the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper
<s> if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any
<s> and yet i don t know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all
<s> said i could not swim you can t swim can you he added turning to the knave
<s> the knave shook his head sadly
<s> do i look like it he said
<s> which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard
<s> all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true that s the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know
<s> but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice
<s> why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table
<s> nothing can be clearer than that
<s> then again before she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queen
<s> never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke
<s> the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted
<s> then the words don t fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile
<s> there was a dead silence
<s> it s a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that day
<s> no no said the queen
<s> sentence first verdict afterwards
<s> stuff and nonsense said alice loudly
<s> the idea of having the sentence first
<s> hold your tongue said the queen turning purple
<s> i won t said alice
<s> off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice
<s> nobody moved
<s> who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time
<s> you re nothing but a pack of cards
<s> at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face
<s> wake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep you ve had
<s> oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s getting late
<s> so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been
<s> but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream
<s> first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister s dream
<s> the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the duchess s knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizard s slate pencil and the choking of the suppressed guinea pigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle
<s> so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep bells and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s heavy sobs
<s> lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the after time be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own child life and the happy summer days

<s> livesey and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island from the beginning to the end keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted i take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof
<s> i remember him as if it were yesterday as he came plodding to the inn door his sea chest following behind him in a hand barrow a tall strong heavy nut brown man his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat his hands ragged and scarred with black broken nails and the sabre cut across one cheek a dirty livid white
<s> i remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so and then breaking out in that old sea song that he sang so often afterwards
<s> fifteen men on the dead man s chest
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> in the high old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars
<s> then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried and when my father appeared called roughly for a glass of rum
<s> this when it was brought to him he drank slowly like a connoisseur lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard
<s> this is a handy cove says he at length and a pleasant sittyated grog shop
<s> much company mate
<s> my father told him no very little company the more was the pity
<s> well then said he this is the berth for me
<s> here you matey he cried to the man who trundled the barrow bring up alongside and help up my chest
<s> i ll stay here a bit he continued
<s> i m a plain man rum and bacon and eggs is what i want and that head up there for to watch ships off
<s> what you mought call me you mought call me captain
<s> oh i see what you re at there and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold
<s> you can tell me when i ve worked through that says he looking as fierce as a commander
<s> and indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike
<s> the man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the royal george that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast and hearing ours well spoken of i suppose and described as lonely had chosen it from the others for his place of residence
<s> and that was all we could learn of our guest
<s> he was a very silent man by custom
<s> all day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong
<s> mostly he would not speak when spoken to only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog horn and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be
<s> every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road
<s> at first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them
<s> when a seaman did put up at the admiral benbow as now and then some did making by the coast road for bristol he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present
<s> for me at least there was no secret about the matter for i was in a way a sharer in his alarms
<s> he had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if i would only keep my weather eye open for a seafaring man with one leg and let him know the moment he appeared
<s> often enough when the first of the month came round and i applied to him for my wage he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it bring me my four penny piece and repeat his orders to look out for the seafaring man with one leg
<s> how that personage haunted my dreams i need scarcely tell you
<s> on stormy nights when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs i would see him in a thousand forms and with a thousand diabolical expressions
<s> now the leg would be cut off at the knee now at the hip now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg and that in the middle of his body
<s> to see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares
<s> and altogether i paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece in the shape of these abominable fancies
<s> but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him
<s> there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild sea songs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing
<s> often i have heard the house shaking with yo ho ho and a bottle of rum all the neighbours joining in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark
<s> for in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so he judged the company was not following his story
<s> nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed
<s> his stories were what frightened people worst of all
<s> dreadful stories they were about hanging and walking the plank and storms at sea and the dry tortugas and wild deeds and places on the spanish main
<s> by his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that god ever allowed upon the sea and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described
<s> my father was always saying the inn would be ruined for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down and sent shivering to their beds but i really believe his presence did us good
<s> people were frightened at the time but on looking back they rather liked it it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him calling him a true sea dog and a real old salt and such like names and saying there was the sort of man that made england terrible at sea
<s> in one way indeed he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on staying week after week and at last month after month so that all the money had been long exhausted and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more
<s> if ever he mentioned it the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared and stared my poor father out of the room
<s> i have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff and i am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death
<s> all the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker
<s> one of the cocks of his hat having fallen down he let it hang from that day forth though it was a great annoyance when it blew
<s> i remember the appearance of his coat which he patched himself upstairs in his room and which before the end was nothing but patches
<s> he never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke with any but the neighbours and with these for the most part only when drunk on rum
<s> the great sea chest none of us had ever seen open
<s> he was only once crossed and that was towards the end when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off
<s> dr
<s> livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient took a bit of dinner from my mother and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet for we had no stabling at the old benbow
<s> i followed him in and i remember observing the contrast the neat bright doctor with his powder as white as snow and his bright black eyes and pleasant manners made with the coltish country folk and above all with that filthy heavy bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours sitting far gone in rum with his arms on the table
<s> suddenly he the captain that is began to pipe up his eternal song
<s> fifteen men on the dead man s chest
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> drink and the devil had done for the rest
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> at first i had supposed the dead man s chest to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one legged seafaring man
<s> but by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song it was new that night to nobody but dr
<s> livesey and on him i observed it did not produce an agreeable effect for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor the gardener on a new cure for the rheumatics
<s> in the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at his own music and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence
<s> the voices stopped at once all but dr
<s> livesey s he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two
<s> the captain glared at him for a while flapped his hand again glared still harder and at last broke out with a villainous low oath silence there between decks
<s> were you addressing me sir says the doctor and when the ruffian had told him with another oath that this was so i have only one thing to say to you sir replies the doctor that if you keep on drinking rum the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel
<s> the old fellow s fury was awful
<s> he sprang to his feet drew and opened a sailor s clasp knife and balancing it open on the palm of his hand threatened to pin the doctor to the wall
<s> the doctor never so much as moved
<s> he spoke to him as before over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice rather high so that all the room might hear but perfectly calm and steady if you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket i promise upon my honour you shall hang at the next assizes
<s> 0033m
<s> then followed a battle of looks between them but the captain soon knuckled under put up his weapon and resumed his seat grumbling like a beaten dog
<s> and now sir continued the doctor since i now know there s such a fellow in my district you may count i ll have an eye upon you day and night
<s> i m not a doctor only i m a magistrate and if i catch a breath of complaint against you if it s only for a piece of incivility like tonight s i ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this
<s> let that suffice
<s> soon after dr
<s> livesey s horse came to the door and he rode away but the captain held his peace that evening and for many evenings to come

<s> 9037m
<s> t was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain though not as you will see of his affairs
<s> it was a bitter cold winter with long hard frosts and heavy gales and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring
<s> he sank daily and my mother and i had all the inn upon our hands and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest
<s> it was one january morning very early a pinching frosty morning the cove all grey with hoar frost the ripple lapping softly on the stones the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward
<s> the captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat his brass telescope under his arm his hat tilted back upon his head
<s> i remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off and the last sound i heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation as though his mind was still running upon dr
<s> livesey
<s> well mother was upstairs with father and i was laying the breakfast table against the captain s return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom i had never set my eyes before
<s> he was a pale tallowy creature wanting two fingers of the left hand and though he wore a cutlass he did not look much like a fighter
<s> i had always my eye open for seafaring men with one leg or two and i remember this one puzzled me
<s> he was not sailorly and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too
<s> i asked him what was for his service and he said he would take rum but as i was going out of the room to fetch it he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near
<s> i paused where i was with my napkin in my hand
<s> come here sonny says he
<s> come nearer here
<s> i took a step nearer
<s> is this here table for my mate bill he asked with a kind of leer
<s> i told him i did not know his mate bill and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain
<s> well said he my mate bill would be called the captain as like as not
<s> he has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him particularly in drink has my mate bill
<s> we ll put it for argument like that your captain has a cut on one cheek and we ll put it if you like that that cheek s the right one
<s> ah well i told you
<s> now is my mate bill in this here house
<s> i told him he was out walking
<s> which way sonny which way is he gone
<s> and when i had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return and how soon and answered a few other questions ah said he this ll be as good as drink to my mate bill
<s> the expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant and i had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken even supposing he meant what he said
<s> but it was no affair of mine i thought and besides it was difficult to know what to do
<s> the stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse
<s> once i stepped out myself into the road but he immediately called me back and as i did not obey quick enough for his fancy a most horrible change came over his tallowy face and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump
<s> as soon as i was back again he returned to his former manner half fawning half sneering patted me on the shoulder told me i was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me
<s> i have a son of my own said he as like you as two blocks and he s all the pride of my art
<s> but the great thing for boys is discipline sonny discipline
<s> now if you had sailed along of bill you wouldn t have stood there to be spoke to twice not you
<s> that was never bill s way nor the way of sich as sailed with him
<s> and here sure enough is my mate bill with a spy glass under his arm bless his old art to be sure
<s> you and me ll just go back into the parlour sonny and get behind the door and we ll give bill a little surprise bless his art i say again
<s> so saying the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door
<s> i was very uneasy and alarmed as you may fancy and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself
<s> he cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat
<s> at last in strode the captain slammed the door behind him without looking to the right or left and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him
<s> bill said the stranger in a voice that i thought he had tried to make bold and big
<s> the captain spun round on his heel and fronted us all the brown had gone out of his face and even his nose was blue he had the look of a man who sees a ghost or the evil one or something worse if anything can be and upon my word i felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick
<s> come bill you know me you know an old shipmate bill surely said the stranger
<s> the captain made a sort of gasp
<s> black dog said he
<s> and who else returned the other getting more at his ease
<s> black dog as ever was come for to see his old shipmate billy at the admiral benbow inn
<s> ah bill bill we have seen a sight of times us two since i lost them two talons holding up his mutilated hand
<s> now look here said the captain you ve run me down here i am well then speak up what is it
<s> that s you bill returned black dog you re in the right of it billy
<s> i ll have a glass of rum from this dear child here as i ve took such a liking to and we ll sit down if you please and talk square like old shipmates
<s> when i returned with the rum they were already seated on either side of the captain s breakfast table black dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one as i thought on his retreat
<s> he bade me go and leave the door wide open
<s> none of your keyholes for me sonny he said and i left them together and retired into the bar
<s> for a long time though i certainly did my best to listen i could hear nothing but a low gattling but at last the voices began to grow higher and i could pick up a word or two mostly oaths from the captain
<s> no no no no and an end of it he cried once
<s> and again if it comes to swinging swing all say i
<s> 0041m
<s> then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises the chair and table went over in a lump a clash of steel followed and then a cry of pain and the next instant i saw black dog in full flight and the captain hotly pursuing both with drawn cutlasses and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder
<s> just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of admiral benbow
<s> you may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day
<s> that blow was the last of the battle
<s> once out upon the road black dog in spite of his wound showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute
<s> the captain for his part stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man
<s> then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house
<s> jim says he rum and as he spoke he reeled a little and caught himself with one hand against the wall
<s> are you hurt cried i
<s> rum he repeated
<s> i must get away from here
<s> rum rum
<s> i ran to fetch it but i was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out and i broke one glass and fouled the tap and while i was still getting in my own way i heard a loud fall in the parlour and running in beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor
<s> at the same instant my mother alarmed by the cries and fighting came running downstairs to help me
<s> between us we raised his head
<s> he was breathing very loud and hard but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour
<s> dear deary me cried my mother what a disgrace upon the house and your poor father sick
<s> in the meantime we had no idea what to do to help the captain nor any other thought but that he had got his death hurt in the scuffle with the stranger
<s> i got the rum to be sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron
<s> it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey came in on his visit to my father
<s> oh doctor we cried what shall we do where is he wounded
<s> wounded a fiddle stick s end said the doctor
<s> no more wounded than you or i
<s> the man has had a stroke as i warned him
<s> now mrs
<s> hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it
<s> for my part i must do my best to save this fellow s trebly worthless life jim you get me a basin
<s> when i got back with the basin the doctor had already ripped up the captain s sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm
<s> it was tattooed in several places
<s> here s luck a fair wind and billy bones his fancy were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it done as i thought with great spirit
<s> prophetic said the doctor touching this picture with his finger
<s> and now master billy bones if that be your name we ll have a look at the colour of your blood
<s> jim he said are you afraid of blood
<s> no sir said i
<s> well then said he you hold the basin and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein
<s> a great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him
<s> first he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown then his glance fell upon me and he looked relieved
<s> but suddenly his colour changed and he tried to raise himself crying where s black dog
<s> there is no black dog here said the doctor except what you have on your own back
<s> you have been drinking rum you have had a stroke precisely as i told you and i have just very much against my own will dragged you headforemost out of the grave
<s> now mr
<s> bones
<s> that s not my name he interrupted
<s> much i care returned the doctor
<s> it s the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance and i call you by it for the sake of shortness and what i have to say to you is this one glass of rum won t kill you but if you take one you ll take another and another and i stake my wig if you don t break off short you ll die do you understand that die and go to your own place like the man in the bible
<s> come now make an effort
<s> i ll help you to your bed for once
<s> between us with much trouble we managed to hoist him upstairs and laid him on his bed where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting
<s> now mind you said the doctor i clear my conscience the name of rum for you is death
<s> and with that he went off to see my father taking me with him by the arm
<s> this is nothing he said as soon as he had closed the door
<s> i have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile he should lie for a week where he is that is the best thing for him and you but another stroke would settle him
<s> 3
<s> 0046m
<s> the black spot
<s> 9046m
<s> bout noon i stopped at the captain s door with some cooling drinks and medicines
<s> he was lying very much as we had left him only a little higher and he seemed both weak and excited
<s> jim he said you re the only one here that s worth anything and you know i ve been always good to you
<s> never a month but i ve given you a silver fourpenny for yourself
<s> and now you see mate i m pretty low and deserted by all and jim you ll bring me one noggin of rum now won t you matey
<s> the doctor i began
<s> but he broke in cursing the doctor in a feeble voice but heartily
<s> doctors is all swabs he said and that doctor there why what do he know about seafaring men i been in places hot as pitch and mates dropping round with yellow jack and the blessed land a heaving like the sea with earthquakes what to the doctor know of lands like that and i lived on rum i tell you
<s> it s been meat and drink and man and wife to me and if i m not to have my rum now i m a poor old hulk on a lee shore my blood ll be on you jim and that doctor swab and he ran on again for a while with curses
<s> look jim how my fingers fidges he continued in the pleading tone
<s> i can t keep em still not i
<s> i haven t had a drop this blessed day
<s> that doctor s a fool i tell you
<s> if i don t have a dram o rum jim i ll have the horrors i seen some on em already
<s> i seen old flint in the corner there behind you as plain as print i seen him and if i get the horrors i m a man that has lived rough and i ll raise cain
<s> your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn t hurt me
<s> i ll give you a golden guinea for a noggin jim
<s> he was growing more and more excited and this alarmed me for my father who was very low that day and needed quiet besides i was reassured by the doctor s words now quoted to me and rather offended by the offer of a bribe
<s> i want none of your money said i but what you owe my father
<s> i ll get you one glass and no more
<s> when i brought it to him he seized it greedily and drank it out
<s> aye aye said he that s some better sure enough
<s> and now matey did that doctor say how long i was to lie here in this old berth
<s> a week at least said i
<s> thunder he cried
<s> a week i can t do that they d have the black spot on me by then
<s> the lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment lubbers as couldn t keep what they got and want to nail what is another s
<s> is that seamanly behaviour now i want to know but i m a saving soul
<s> i never wasted good money of mine nor lost it neither and i ll trick em again
<s> i m not afraid on em
<s> i ll shake out another reef matey and daddle em again
<s> as he was thus speaking he had risen from bed with great difficulty holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out and moving his legs like so much dead weight
<s> his words spirited as they were in meaning contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered
<s> he paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge
<s> that doctor s done me he murmured
<s> my ears is singing
<s> lay me back
<s> before i could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place where he lay for a while silent
<s> jim he said at length you saw that seafaring man today
<s> black dog i asked
<s> ah black dog says he
<s> he s a bad un but there s worse that put him on
<s> now if i can t get away nohow and they tip me the black spot mind you it s my old sea chest they re after you get on a horse you can can t you well then you get on a horse and go to well yes i will to that eternal doctor swab and tell him to pipe all hands magistrates and sich and he ll lay em aboard at the admiral benbow all old flint s crew man and boy all on em that s left
<s> i was first mate i was old flint s first mate and i m the on y one as knows the place
<s> he gave it me at savannah when he lay a dying like as if i was to now you see
<s> but you won t peach unless they get the black spot on me or unless you see that black dog again or a seafaring man with one leg jim him above all
<s> but what is the black spot captain i asked
<s> that s a summons mate
<s> i ll tell you if they get that
<s> but you keep your weather eye open jim and i ll share with you equals upon my honour
<s> he wandered a little longer his voice growing weaker but soon after i had given him his medicine which he took like a child with the remark if ever a seaman wanted drugs it s me he fell at last into a heavy swoon like sleep in which i left him
<s> what i should have done had all gone well i do not know
<s> probably i should have told the whole story to the doctor for i was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me
<s> but as things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly that evening which put all other matters on one side
<s> our natural distress the visits of the neighbours the arranging of the funeral and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that i had scarcely time to think of the captain far less to be afraid of him
<s> he got downstairs next morning to be sure and had his meals as usual though he ate little and had more i am afraid than his usual supply of rum for he helped himself out of the bar scowling and blowing through his nose and no one dared to cross him
<s> on the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever and it was shocking in that house of mourning to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea song but weak as he was we were all in the fear of death for him and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my father s death
<s> i have said the captain was weak and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength
<s> he clambered up and down stairs and went from the parlour to the bar and back again and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain
<s> he never particularly addressed me and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences but his temper was more flighty and allowing for his bodily weakness more violent than ever
<s> he had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table
<s> but with all that he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering
<s> once for instance to our extreme wonder he piped up to a different air a kind of country love song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea
<s> so things passed until the day after the funeral and about three o clock of a bitter foggy frosty afternoon i was standing at the door for a moment full of sad thoughts about my father when i saw someone drawing slowly near along the road
<s> he was plainly blind for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose and he was hunched as if with age or weakness and wore a huge old tattered sea cloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed
<s> i never saw in my life a more dreadful looking figure
<s> he stopped a little from the inn and raising his voice in an odd sing song addressed the air in front of him will any kind friend inform a poor blind man who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country england and god bless king george where or in what part of this country he may now be
<s> you are at the admiral benbow black hill cove my good man said i
<s> i hear a voice said he a young voice
<s> will you give me your hand my kind young friend and lead me in
<s> i held out my hand and the horrible soft spoken eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise
<s> i was so much startled that i struggled to withdraw but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm
<s> now boy he said take me in to the captain
<s> sir said i upon my word i dare not
<s> oh he sneered that s it take me in straight or i ll break your arm
<s> and he gave it as he spoke a wrench that made me cry out
<s> sir said i it is for yourself i mean
<s> the captain is not what he used to be
<s> he sits with a drawn cutlass
<s> another gentleman
<s> come now march interrupted he and i never heard a voice so cruel and cold and ugly as that blind man s
<s> it cowed me more than the pain and i began to obey him at once walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour where our sick old buccaneer was sitting dazed with rum
<s> the blind man clung close to me holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than i could carry
<s> lead me straight up to him and when i m in view cry out here s a friend for you bill
<s> if you don t i ll do this and with that he gave me a twitch that i thought would have made me faint
<s> between this and that i was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of the captain and as i opened the parlour door cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice
<s> 0051m
<s> the poor captain raised his eyes and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober
<s> the expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness
<s> he made a movement to rise but i do not believe he had enough force left in his body
<s> now bill sit where you are said the beggar
<s> if i can t see i can hear a finger stirring
<s> business is business
<s> hold out your left hand
<s> boy take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right
<s> we both obeyed him to the letter and i saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain s which closed upon it instantly
<s> and now that s done said the blind man and at the words he suddenly left hold of me and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness skipped out of the parlour and into the road where as i still stood motionless i could hear his stick go tap tap tapping into the distance
<s> it was some time before either i or the captain seemed to gather our senses but at length and about at the same moment i released his wrist which i was still holding and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm
<s> ten o clock he cried
<s> six hours
<s> we ll do them yet and he sprang to his feet
<s> even as he did so he reeled put his hand to his throat stood swaying for a moment and then with a peculiar sound fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor
<s> i ran to him at once calling to my mother
<s> but haste was all in vain
<s> the captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy
<s> it is a curious thing to understand for i had certainly never liked the man though of late i had begun to pity him but as soon as i saw that he was dead i burst into a flood of tears
<s> it was the second death i had known and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart
<s> 4
<s> 0054m
<s> the sea chest
<s> 9054m
<s> lost no time of course in telling my mother all that i knew and perhaps should have told her long before and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position
<s> some of the man s money if he had any was certainly due to us but it was not likely that our captain s shipmates above all the two specimens seen by me black dog and the blind beggar would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man s debts
<s> the captain s order to mount at once and ride for doctor livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected which was not to be thought of
<s> indeed it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house the fall of coals in the kitchen grate the very ticking of the clock filled us with alarms
<s> the neighbourhood to our ears seemed haunted by approaching footsteps and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return there were moments when as the saying goes i jumped in my skin for terror
<s> something must speedily be resolved upon and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet
<s> no sooner said than done
<s> bare headed as we were we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog
<s> the hamlet lay not many hundred yards away though out of view on the other side of the next cove and what greatly encouraged me it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned
<s> we were not many minutes on the road though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken
<s> but there was no unusual sound nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood
<s> it was already candle light when we reached the hamlet and i shall never forget how much i was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows but that as it proved was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter
<s> for you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves no soul would consent to return with us to the admiral benbow
<s> the more we told of our troubles the more man woman and child they clung to the shelter of their houses
<s> the name of captain flint though it was strange to me was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror
<s> some of the men who had been to field work on the far side of the admiral benbow remembered besides to have seen several strangers on the road and taking them to be smugglers to have bolted away and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called kitt s hole
<s> for that matter anyone who was a comrade of the captain s was enough to frighten them to death
<s> and the short and the long of the matter was that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to dr
<s> livesey s which lay in another direction not one would help us to defend the inn
<s> they say cowardice is infectious but then argument is on the other hand a great emboldener and so when each had said his say my mother made them a speech
<s> she would not she declared lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy if none of the rest of you dare she said jim and i dare
<s> back we will go the way we came and small thanks to you big hulking chicken hearted men
<s> we ll have that chest open if we die for it
<s> and i ll thank you for that bag mrs
<s> crossley to bring back our lawful money in
<s> of course i said i would go with my mother and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness but even then not a man would go along with us
<s> all they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor s in search of armed assistance
<s> my heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture
<s> a full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog and this increased our haste for it was plain before we came forth again that all would be as bright as day and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers
<s> we slipped along the hedges noiseless and swift nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors till to our relief the door of the admiral benbow had closed behind us
<s> i slipped the bolt at once and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark alone in the house with the dead captain s body
<s> then my mother got a candle in the bar and holding each other s hands we advanced into the parlour
<s> he lay as we had left him on his back with his eyes open and one arm stretched out
<s> draw down the blind jim whispered my mother they might come and watch outside
<s> and now said she when i had done so we have to get the key off that and who s to touch it i should like to know and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words
<s> i went down on my knees at once
<s> on the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper blackened on the one side
<s> i could not doubt that this was the black spot and taking it up i found written on the other side in a very good clear hand this short message you have till ten tonight
<s> he had till ten mother said i and just as i said it our old clock began striking
<s> this sudden noise startled us shockingly but the news was good for it was only six
<s> now jim she said that key
<s> i felt in his pockets one after another
<s> a few small coins a thimble and some thread and big needles a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end his gully with the crooked handle a pocket compass and a tinder box were all that they contained and i began to despair
<s> perhaps it s round his neck suggested my mother
<s> overcoming a strong repugnance i tore open his shirt at the neck and there sure enough hanging to a bit of tarry string which i cut with his own gully we found the key
<s> at this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival
<s> it was like any other seaman s chest on the outside the initial b burned on the top of it with a hot iron and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long rough usage
<s> give me the key said my mother and though the lock was very stiff she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling
<s> a strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes carefully brushed and folded
<s> they had never been worn my mother said
<s> under that the miscellany began a quadrant a tin canikin several sticks of tobacco two brace of very handsome pistols a piece of bar silver an old spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make a pair of compasses mounted with brass and five or six curious west indian shells
<s> i have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering guilty and hunted life
<s> in the meantime we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets and neither of these were in our way
<s> underneath there was an old boat cloak whitened with sea salt on many a harbour bar
<s> my mother pulled it up with impatience and there lay before us the last things in the chest a bundle tied up in oilcloth and looking like papers and a canvas bag that gave forth at a touch the jingle of gold
<s> i ll show these rogues that i m an honest woman said my mother
<s> i ll have my dues and not a farthing over
<s> hold mrs
<s> crossley s bag
<s> and she began to count over the amount of the captain s score from the sailor s bag into the one that i was holding
<s> 0059m
<s> it was a long difficult business for the coins were of all countries and sizes doubloons and louis d ors and guineas and pieces of eight and i know not what besides all shaken together at random
<s> the guineas too were about the scarcest and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count
<s> when we were about half way through i suddenly put my hand upon her arm for i had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth the tap tapping of the blind man s stick upon the frozen road
<s> it drew nearer and nearer while we sat holding our breath
<s> then it struck sharp on the inn door and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter and then there was a long time of silence both within and without
<s> at last the tapping recommenced and to our indescribable joy and gratitude died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard
<s> mother said i take the whole and let s be going for i was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet s nest about our ears though how thankful i was that i had bolted it none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man
<s> but my mother frightened as she was would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less
<s> it was not yet seven she said by a long way she knew her rights and she would have them and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill
<s> that was enough and more than enough for both of us
<s> i ll take what i have she said jumping to her feet
<s> and i ll take this to square the count said i picking up the oilskin packet
<s> next moment we were both groping downstairs leaving the candle by the empty chest and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat
<s> we had not started a moment too soon
<s> the fog was rapidly dispersing already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape
<s> far less than half way to the hamlet very little beyond the bottom of the hill we must come forth into the moonlight
<s> nor was this all for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears and as we looked back in their direction a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern
<s> my dear said my mother suddenly take the money and run on
<s> i am going to faint
<s> this was certainly the end for both of us i thought
<s> how i cursed the cowardice of the neighbours how i blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed for her past foolhardiness and present weakness we were just at the little bridge by good fortune and i helped her tottering as she was to the edge of the bank where sure enough she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder
<s> i do not know how i found the strength to do it at all and i am afraid it was roughly done but i managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch
<s> farther i could not move her for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it
<s> so there we had to stay my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn
<s> 5
<s> 0062m
<s> the last of the blind man
<s> 9062m
<s> y curiosity in a sense was stronger than my fear for i could not remain where i was but crept back to the bank again whence sheltering my head behind a bush of broom i might command the road before our door
<s> i was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive seven or eight of them running hard their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front
<s> three men ran together hand in hand and i made out even through the mist that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar
<s> the next moment his voice showed me that i was right
<s> down with the door he cried
<s> aye aye sir answered two or three and a rush was made upon the admiral benbow the lantern bearer following and then i could see them pause and hear speeches passed in a lower key as if they were surprised to find the door open
<s> but the pause was brief for the blind man again issued his commands
<s> his voice sounded louder and higher as if he were afire with eagerness and rage
<s> in in in he shouted and cursed them for their delay
<s> four or five of them obeyed at once two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar
<s> there was a pause then a cry of surprise and then a voice shouting from the house bill s dead
<s> but the blind man swore at them again for their delay
<s> search him some of you shirking lubbers and the rest of you aloft and get the chest he cried
<s> i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs so that the house must have shook with it
<s> promptly afterwards fresh sounds of astonishment arose the window of the captain s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass and a man leaned out into the moonlight head and shoulders and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him
<s> pew he cried they ve been before us
<s> someone s turned the chest out alow and aloft
<s> is it there roared pew
<s> the money s there
<s> the blind man cursed the money
<s> flint s fist i mean he cried
<s> we don t see it here nohow returned the man
<s> here you below there is it on bill cried the blind man again
<s> at that another fellow probably him who had remained below to search the captain s body came to the door of the inn
<s> bill s been overhauled a ready said he nothin left
<s> it s these people of the inn it s that boy
<s> i wish i had put his eyes out cried the blind man pew
<s> there were no time ago they had the door bolted when i tried it
<s> scatter lads and find em
<s> sure enough they left their glim here said the fellow from the window
<s> scatter and find em rout the house out reiterated pew striking with his stick upon the road
<s> then there followed a great to do through all our old inn heavy feet pounding to and fro furniture thrown over doors kicked in until the very rocks re echoed and the men came out again one after another on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found
<s> and just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain s money was once more clearly audible through the night but this time twice repeated
<s> i had thought it to be the blind man s trumpet so to speak summoning his crew to the assault but i now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet and from its effect upon the buccaneers a signal to warn them of approaching danger
<s> there s dirk again said one
<s> twice we ll have to budge mates
<s> budge you skulk cried pew
<s> dirk was a fool and a coward from the first you wouldn t mind him
<s> they must be close by they can t be far you have your hands on it
<s> scatter and look for them dogs oh shiver my soul he cried if i had eyes
<s> this appeal seemed to produce some effect for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber but half heartedly i thought and with half an eye to their own danger all the time while the rest stood irresolute on the road
<s> you have your hands on thousands you fools and you hang a leg you d be as rich as kings if you could find it and you know it s here and you stand there skulking
<s> there wasn t one of you dared face bill and i did it a blind man and i m to lose my chance for you i m to be a poor crawling beggar sponging for rum when i might be rolling in a coach if you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still
<s> hang it pew we ve got the doubloons grumbled one
<s> they might have hid the blessed thing said another
<s> take the georges pew and don t stand here squalling
<s> squalling was the word for it pew s anger rose so high at these objections till at last his passion completely taking the upper hand he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one
<s> 0065m
<s> these in their turn cursed back at the blind miscreant threatened him in horrid terms and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp
<s> this quarrel was the saving of us for while it was still raging another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet the tramp of horses galloping
<s> almost at the same time a pistol shot flash and report came from the hedge side
<s> and that was plainly the last signal of danger for the buccaneers turned at once and ran separating in every direction one seaward along the cove one slant across the hill and so on so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but pew
<s> him they had deserted whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not but there he remained behind tapping up and down the road in a frenzy and groping and calling for his comrades
<s> finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me towards the hamlet crying johnny black dog dirk and other names you won t leave old pew mates not old pew
<s> just then the noise of horses topped the rise and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope
<s> at this pew saw his error turned with a scream and ran straight for the ditch into which he rolled
<s> but he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash now utterly bewildered right under the nearest of the coming horses
<s> the rider tried to save him but in vain
<s> down went pew with a cry that rang high into the night and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by
<s> he fell on his side then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more
<s> i leaped to my feet and hailed the riders
<s> they were pulling up at any rate horrified at the accident and i soon saw what they were
<s> one tailing out behind the rest was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to dr
<s> livesey s the rest were revenue officers whom he had met by the way and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once
<s> some news of the lugger in kitt s hole had found its way to supervisor dance and set him forth that night in our direction and to that circumstance my mother and i owed our preservation from death
<s> pew was dead stone dead
<s> as for my mother when we had carried her up to the hamlet a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again and she was none the worse for her terror though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money
<s> in the meantime the supervisor rode on as fast as he could to kitt s hole but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle leading and sometimes supporting their horses and in continual fear of ambushes so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the hole the lugger was already under way though still close in
<s> he hailed her
<s> a voice replied telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm
<s> soon after the lugger doubled the point and disappeared
<s> mr
<s> dance stood there as he said like a fish out of water and all he could do was to dispatch a man to b to warn the cutter
<s> and that said he is just about as good as nothing
<s> they ve got off clean and there s an end
<s> only he added i m glad i trod on master pew s corns for by this time he had heard my story
<s> i went back with him to the admiral benbow and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain s money bag and a little silver from the till i could see at once that we were ruined
<s> mr
<s> dance could make nothing of the scene
<s> they got the money you say well then hawkins what in fortune were they after more money i suppose
<s> no sir not money i think replied i
<s> in fact sir i believe i have the thing in my breast pocket and to tell you the truth i should like to get it put in safety
<s> to be sure boy quite right said he
<s> i ll take it if you like
<s> i thought perhaps dr
<s> livesey i began
<s> perfectly right he interrupted very cheerily perfectly right a gentleman and a magistrate
<s> and now i come to think of it i might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire
<s> master pew s dead when all s done not that i regret it but he s dead you see and people will make it out against an officer of his majesty s revenue if make it out they can
<s> now i ll tell you hawkins if you like i ll take you along
<s> i thanked him heartily for the offer and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were
<s> by the time i had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle
<s> dogger said mr
<s> dance you have a good horse take up this lad behind you
<s> as soon as i was mounted holding on to dogger s belt the supervisor gave the word and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to dr
<s> livesey s house
<s> 6
<s> 0070m
<s> the captain s papers
<s> 9070m
<s> e rode hard all the way till we drew up before dr
<s> livesey s door
<s> the house was all dark to the front
<s> mr
<s> dance told me to jump down and knock and dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by
<s> the door was opened almost at once by the maid
<s> is dr
<s> livesey in i asked
<s> no she said he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire
<s> so there we go boys said mr
<s> dance
<s> this time as the distance was short i did not mount but ran with dogger s stirrup leather to the lodge gates and up the long leafless moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens
<s> here mr
<s> dance dismounted and taking me along with him was admitted at a word into the house
<s> the servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them where the squire and dr
<s> livesey sat pipe in hand on either side of a bright fire
<s> i had never seen the squire so near at hand
<s> he was a tall man over six feet high and broad in proportion and he had a bluff rough and ready face all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels
<s> his eyebrows were very black and moved readily and this gave him a look of some temper not bad you would say but quick and high
<s> come in mr
<s> dance says he very stately and condescending
<s> good evening dance says the doctor with a nod
<s> and good evening to you friend jim
<s> what good wind brings you here
<s> the supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest
<s> when they heard how my mother went back to the inn dr
<s> livesey fairly slapped his thigh and the squire cried bravo and broke his long pipe against the grate
<s> long before it was done mr
<s> trelawney that you will remember was the squire s name had got up from his seat and was striding about the room and the doctor as if to hear the better had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close cropped black poll
<s> at last mr
<s> dance finished the story
<s> mr
<s> dance said the squire you are a very noble fellow
<s> and as for riding down that black atrocious miscreant i regard it as an act of virtue sir like stamping on a cockroach
<s> this lad hawkins is a trump i perceive
<s> hawkins will you ring that bell mr
<s> dance must have some ale
<s> and so jim said the doctor you have the thing that they were after have you
<s> here it is sir said i and gave him the oilskin packet
<s> the doctor looked it all over as if his fingers were itching to open it but instead of doing that he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat
<s> squire said he when dance has had his ale he must of course be off on his majesty s service but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to sleep at my house and with your permission i propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup
<s> as you will livesey said the squire hawkins has earned better than cold pie
<s> so a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable and i made a hearty supper for i was as hungry as a hawk while mr
<s> dance was further complimented and at last dismissed
<s> and now squire said the doctor
<s> and now livesey said the squire in the same breath
<s> one at a time one at a time laughed dr
<s> livesey
<s> you have heard of this flint i suppose
<s> heard of him cried the squire
<s> heard of him you say he was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed
<s> blackbeard was a child to flint
<s> the spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that i tell you sir i was sometimes proud he was an englishman
<s> i ve seen his top sails with these eyes off trinidad and the cowardly son of a rum puncheon that i sailed with put back put back sir into port of spain
<s> well i ve heard of him myself in england said the doctor
<s> but the point is had he money
<s> money cried the squire
<s> have you heard the story what were these villains after but money what do they care for but money for what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money
<s> that we shall soon know replied the doctor
<s> but you are so confoundedly hot headed and exclamatory that i cannot get a word in
<s> what i want to know is this supposing that i have here in my pocket some clue to where flint buried his treasure will that treasure amount to much
<s> amount sir cried the squire
<s> it will amount to this if we have the clue you talk about i fit out a ship in bristol dock and take you and hawkins here along and i ll have that treasure if i search a year
<s> very well said the doctor
<s> now then if jim is agreeable we ll open the packet and he laid it before him on the table
<s> the bundle was sewn together and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors
<s> it contained two things a book and a sealed paper
<s> first of all we ll try the book observed the doctor
<s> the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it for dr
<s> livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side table where i had been eating to enjoy the sport of the search
<s> on the first page there were only some scraps of writing such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice
<s> one was the same as the tattoo mark billy bones his fancy then there was mr
<s> w
<s> bones mate no more rum off palm key he got itt and some other snatches mostly single words and unintelligible
<s> i could not help wondering who it was that had got itt and what itt was that he got
<s> a knife in his back as like as not
<s> not much instruction there said dr
<s> livesey as he passed on
<s> the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries
<s> there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money as in common account books but instead of explanatory writing only a varying number of crosses between the two
<s> on the 12th of june 1745 for instance a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause
<s> in a few cases to be sure the name of a place would be added as offe caraccas or a mere entry of latitude and longitude as 62o 17 20 19o 2 40
<s> the record lasted over nearly twenty years the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions and these words appended bones his pile
<s> i can t make head or tail of this said dr
<s> livesey
<s> the thing is as clear as noonday cried the squire
<s> this is the black hearted hound s account book
<s> these crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered
<s> the sums are the scoundrel s share and where he feared an ambiguity you see he added something clearer
<s> offe caraccas now you see here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast
<s> god help the poor souls that manned her coral long ago
<s> right said the doctor
<s> see what it is to be a traveller
<s> right and the amounts increase you see as he rose in rank
<s> there was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing french english and spanish moneys to a common value
<s> thrifty man cried the doctor
<s> he wasn t the one to be cheated
<s> and now said the squire for the other
<s> 0075m
<s> the paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal the very thimble perhaps that i had found in the captain s pocket
<s> the doctor opened the seals with great care and there fell out the map of an island with latitude and longitude soundings names of hills and bays and inlets and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores
<s> it was about nine miles long and five across shaped you might say like a fat dragon standing up and had two fine land locked harbours and a hill in the centre part marked the spy glass
<s> there were several additions of a later date but above all three crosses of red ink two on the north part of the island one in the southwest and beside this last in the same red ink and in a small neat hand very different from the captain s tottery characters these words bulk of treasure here
<s> over on the back the same hand had written this further information

<s> there s only one man i m afraid of
<s> and who s that cried the squire
<s> name the dog sir
<s> you replied the doctor for you cannot hold your tongue
<s> we are not the only men who know of this paper
<s> these fellows who attacked the inn tonight bold desperate blades for sure and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger and more i dare say not far off are one and all through thick and thin bound that they ll get that money
<s> we must none of us go alone till we get to sea
<s> jim and i shall stick together in the meanwhile you ll take joyce and hunter when you ride to bristol and from first to last not one of us must breathe a word of what we ve found

<s> 0083m
<s> i go to bristol
<s> 9083m
<s> t was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea and none of our first plans not even dr
<s> livesey s of keeping me beside him could be carried out as we intended
<s> the doctor had to go to london for a physician to take charge of his practice the squire was hard at work at bristol and i lived on at the hall under the charge of old redruth the gamekeeper almost a prisoner but full of sea dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures
<s> i brooded by the hour together over the map all the details of which i well remembered
<s> sitting by the fire in the housekeeper s room i approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction i explored every acre of its surface i climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the spy glass and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects
<s> sometimes the isle was thick with savages with whom we fought sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures
<s> so the weeks passed on till one fine day there came a letter addressed to dr
<s> livesey with this addition to be opened in the case of his absence by tom redruth or young hawkins
<s> obeying this order we found or rather i found for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print the following important news
<s> old anchor inn bristol march 1 17
<s> dear livesey as i do not know whether you are at the hall or still in london i send this in double to both places
<s> the ship is bought and fitted
<s> she lies at anchor ready for sea
<s> you never imagined a sweeter schooner a child might sail her two hundred tons name hispaniola
<s> i got her through my old friend blandly who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump
<s> the admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest and so i may say did everyone in bristol as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for treasure i mean
<s> redruth said i interrupting the letter dr
<s> livesey will not like that
<s> the squire has been talking after all
<s> well who s a better right growled the gamekeeper
<s> a pretty rum go if squire ain t to talk for dr
<s> livesey i should think
<s> at that i gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on
<s> blandly himself found the hispaniola and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle
<s> there is a class of men in bristol monstrously prejudiced against blandly
<s> they go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money that the hispaniola belonged to him and that he sold it me absurdly high the most transparent calumnies
<s> none of them dare however to deny the merits of the ship
<s> so far there was not a hitch
<s> the workpeople to be sure riggers and what not were most annoyingly slow but time cured that
<s> it was the crew that troubled me
<s> i wished a round score of men in case of natives buccaneers or the odious french and i had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that i required
<s> i was standing on the dock when by the merest accident i fell in talk with him
<s> i found he was an old sailor kept a public house knew all the seafaring men in bristol had lost his health ashore and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again
<s> he had hobbled down there that morning he said to get a smell of the salt
<s> i was monstrously touched so would you have been and out of pure pity i engaged him on the spot to be ship s cook
<s> long john silver he is called and has lost a leg but that i regarded as a recommendation since he lost it in his country s service under the immortal hawke
<s> he has no pension livesey
<s> imagine the abominable age we live in
<s> well sir i thought i had only found a cook but it was a crew i had discovered
<s> between silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable not pretty to look at but fellows by their faces of the most indomitable spirit
<s> i declare we could fight a frigate
<s> long john even got rid of two out of the six or seven i had already engaged
<s> he showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance
<s> i am in the most magnificent health and spirits eating like a bull sleeping like a tree yet i shall not enjoy a moment till i hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan
<s> seaward ho hang the treasure it s the glory of the sea that has turned my head
<s> so now livesey come post do not lose an hour if you respect me
<s> let young hawkins go at once to see his mother with redruth for a guard and then both come full speed to bristol
<s> john trelawney
<s> postscript i did not tell you that blandly who by the way is to send a consort after us if we don t turn up by the end of august had found an admirable fellow for sailing master a stiff man which i regret but in all other respects a treasure
<s> long john silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate a man named arrow
<s> i have a boatswain who pipes livesey so things shall go man o war fashion on board the good ship hispaniola
<s> i forgot to tell you that silver is a man of substance i know of my own knowledge that he has a banker s account which has never been overdrawn
<s> he leaves his wife to manage the inn and as she is a woman of colour a pair of old bachelors like you and i may be excused for guessing that it is the wife quite as much as the health that sends him back to roving

<s> you can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me
<s> i was half beside myself with glee and if ever i despised a man it was old tom redruth who could do nothing but grumble and lament
<s> any of the under gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him but such was not the squire s pleasure and the squire s pleasure was like law among them all
<s> nobody but old redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble
<s> the next morning he and i set out on foot for the admiral benbow and there i found my mother in good health and spirits
<s> the captain who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort was gone where the wicked cease from troubling
<s> the squire had had everything repaired and the public rooms and the sign repainted and had added some furniture above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar
<s> he had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while i was gone
<s> it was on seeing that boy that i understood for the first time my situation
<s> i had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me not at all of the home that i was leaving and now at sight of this clumsy stranger who was to stay here in my place beside my mother i had my first attack of tears
<s> i am afraid i led that boy a dog s life for as he was new to the work i had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down and i was not slow to profit by them
<s> 0087m
<s> the night passed and the next day after dinner redruth and i were afoot again and on the road
<s> i said good bye to mother and the cove where i had lived since i was born and the dear old admiral benbow since he was repainted no longer quite so dear
<s> one of my last thoughts was of the captain who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat his sabre cut cheek and his old brass telescope
<s> next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight
<s> the mail picked us up about dusk at the royal george on the heath
<s> i was wedged in between redruth and a stout old gentleman and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air i must have dozed a great deal from the very first and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage for when i was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs and i opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time
<s> where are we i asked
<s> bristol said tom
<s> get down
<s> mr
<s> trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner
<s> thither we had now to walk and our way to my great delight lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations
<s> in one sailors were singing at their work in another there were men aloft high over my head hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider s
<s> though i had lived by the shore all my life i seemed never to have been near the sea till then
<s> the smell of tar and salt was something new
<s> i saw the most wonderful figureheads that had all been far over the ocean
<s> i saw besides many old sailors with rings in their ears and whiskers curled in ringlets and tarry pigtails and their swaggering clumsy sea walk and if i had seen as many kings or archbishops i could not have been more delighted
<s> and i was going to sea myself to sea in a schooner with a piping boatswain and pig tailed singing seamen to sea bound for an unknown island and to seek for buried treasure
<s> while i was still in this delightful dream we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met squire trelawney all dressed out like a sea officer in stout blue cloth coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor s walk
<s> here you are he cried and the doctor came last night from london
<s> bravo the ship s company complete
<s> oh sir cried i when do we sail
<s> sail says he
<s> we sail tomorrow
<s> 0090m
<s> 8
<s> at the sign of the spy glass
<s> 9090m
<s> hen i had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to john silver at the sign of the spy glass and told me i should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign
<s> i set off overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales for the dock was now at its busiest until i found the tavern in question
<s> it was a bright enough little place of entertainment
<s> the sign was newly painted the windows had neat red curtains the floor was cleanly sanded
<s> there was a street on each side and an open door on both which made the large low room pretty clear to see in in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke
<s> the customers were mostly seafaring men and they talked so loudly that i hung at the door almost afraid to enter
<s> as i was waiting a man came out of a side room and at a glance i was sure he must be long john
<s> his left leg was cut off close by the hip and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch which he managed with wonderful dexterity hopping about upon it like a bird
<s> he was very tall and strong with a face as big as a ham plain and pale but intelligent and smiling
<s> indeed he seemed in the most cheerful spirits whistling as he moved about among the tables with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests
<s> now to tell you the truth from the very first mention of long john in squire trelawney s letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one legged sailor whom i had watched for so long at the old benbow
<s> but one look at the man before me was enough
<s> i had seen the captain and black dog and the blind man pew and i thought i knew what a buccaneer was like a very different creature according to me from this clean and pleasant tempered landlord
<s> i plucked up courage at once crossed the threshold and walked right up to the man where he stood propped on his crutch talking to a customer
<s> mr
<s> silver sir i asked holding out the note
<s> yes my lad said he such is my name to be sure
<s> and who may you be and then as he saw the squire s letter he seemed to me to give something almost like a start
<s> oh said he quite loud and offering his hand
<s> i see
<s> you are our new cabin boy pleased i am to see you
<s> and he took my hand in his large firm grasp
<s> just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door
<s> it was close by him and he was out in the street in a moment
<s> but his hurry had attracted my notice and i recognized him at glance
<s> it was the tallow faced man wanting two fingers who had come first to the admiral benbow
<s> 0093m
<s> oh i cried stop him it s black dog
<s> i don t care two coppers who he is cried silver
<s> but he hasn t paid his score
<s> harry run and catch him
<s> one of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit
<s> if he were admiral hawke he shall pay his score cried silver and then relinquishing my hand who did you say he was he asked
<s> black what
<s> dog sir said i
<s> has mr
<s> trelawney not told you of the buccaneers he was one of them
<s> so cried silver
<s> in my house ben run and help harry
<s> one of those swabs was he was that you drinking with him morgan step up here
<s> the man whom he called morgan an old grey haired mahogany faced sailor came forward pretty sheepishly rolling his quid
<s> now morgan said long john very sternly you never clapped your eyes on that black black dog before did you now
<s> not i sir said morgan with a salute
<s> you didn t know his name did you
<s> no sir
<s> by the powers tom morgan it s as good for you exclaimed the landlord
<s> if you had been mixed up with the like of that you would never have put another foot in my house you may lay to that
<s> and what was he saying to you
<s> i don t rightly know sir answered morgan
<s> do you call that a head on your shoulders or a blessed dead eye cried long john
<s> don t rightly know don t you perhaps you don t happen to rightly know who you was speaking to perhaps come now what was he jawing v yages cap ns ships pipe up what was it
<s> we was a talkin of keel hauling answered morgan
<s> keel hauling was you and a mighty suitable thing too and you may lay to that
<s> get back to your place for a lubber tom
<s> and then as morgan rolled back to his seat silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering as i thought he s quite an honest man tom morgan on y stupid
<s> and now he ran on again aloud let s see black dog no i don t know the name not i
<s> yet i kind of think i ve yes i ve seen the swab
<s> he used to come here with a blind beggar he used
<s> that he did you may be sure said i
<s> i knew that blind man too
<s> his name was pew
<s> it was cried silver now quite excited
<s> pew that were his name for certain
<s> ah he looked a shark he did if we run down this black dog now there ll be news for cap n trelawney ben s a good runner few seamen run better than ben
<s> he should run him down hand over hand by the powers he talked o keel hauling did he i ll keel haul him
<s> all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch slapping tables with his hand and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge or a bow street runner
<s> my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding black dog at the spy glass and i watched the cook narrowly
<s> but he was too deep and too ready and too clever for me and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd and been scolded like thieves i would have gone bail for the innocence of long john silver
<s> see here now hawkins said he here s a blessed hard thing on a man like me now ain t it there s cap n trelawney what s he to think here i have this confounded son of a dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum here you comes and tells me of it plain and here i let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights now hawkins you do me justice with the cap n
<s> you re a lad you are but you re as smart as paint
<s> i see that when you first come in
<s> now here it is what could i do with this old timber i hobble on when i was an a b master mariner i d have come up alongside of him hand over hand and broached him to in a brace of old shakes i would but now
<s> and then all of a sudden he stopped and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something
<s> the score he burst out
<s> three goes o rum why shiver my timbers if i hadn t forgotten my score
<s> and falling on a bench he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks
<s> i could not help joining and we laughed together peal after peal until the tavern rang again
<s> why what a precious old sea calf i am he said at last wiping his cheeks
<s> you and me should get on well hawkins for i ll take my davy i should be rated ship s boy
<s> but come now stand by to go about
<s> this won t do
<s> dooty is dooty messmates
<s> i ll put on my old cockerel hat and step along of you to cap n trelawney and report this here affair
<s> for mind you it s serious young hawkins and neither you nor me s come out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit
<s> nor you neither says you not smart none of the pair of us smart
<s> but dash my buttons that was a good un about my score
<s> and he began to laugh again and that so heartily that though i did not see the joke as he did i was again obliged to join him in his mirth
<s> on our little walk along the quays he made himself the most interesting companion telling me about the different ships that we passed by their rig tonnage and nationality explaining the work that was going forward how one was discharging another taking in cargo and a third making ready for sea and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had learned it perfectly
<s> i began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates
<s> when we got to the inn the squire and dr
<s> livesey were seated together finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection
<s> long john told the story from first to last with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth
<s> that was how it were now weren t it hawkins he would say now and again and i could always bear him entirely out
<s> the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away but we all agreed there was nothing to be done and after he had been complimented long john took up his crutch and departed
<s> all hands aboard by four this afternoon shouted the squire after him
<s> aye aye sir cried the cook in the passage
<s> well squire said dr
<s> livesey i don t put much faith in your discoveries as a general thing but i will say this john silver suits me
<s> the man s a perfect trump declared the squire
<s> and now added the doctor jim may come on board with us may he not
<s> to be sure he may says squire
<s> take your hat hawkins and we ll see the ship
<s> 9
<s> 0098m
<s> powder and arms
<s> 9098m
<s> he hispaniola lay some way out and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel and sometimes swung above us
<s> at last however we got alongside and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate mr
<s> arrow a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint
<s> he and the squire were very thick and friendly but i soon observed that things were not the same between mr
<s> trelawney and the captain
<s> this last was a sharp looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us
<s> captain smollett sir axing to speak with you said he
<s> i am always at the captain s orders
<s> show him in said the squire
<s> the captain who was close behind his messenger entered at once and shut the door behind him
<s> well captain smollett what have you to say all well i hope all shipshape and seaworthy
<s> well sir said the captain better speak plain i believe even at the risk of offence
<s> i don t like this cruise i don t like the men and i don t like my officer
<s> that s short and sweet
<s> perhaps sir you don t like the ship inquired the squire very angry as i could see
<s> i can t speak as to that sir not having seen her tried said the captain
<s> she seems a clever craft more i can t say
<s> possibly sir you may not like your employer either says the squire
<s> but here dr
<s> livesey cut in
<s> stay a bit said he stay a bit
<s> no use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling
<s> the captain has said too much or he has said too little and i m bound to say that i require an explanation of his words
<s> you don t you say like this cruise
<s> now why
<s> i was engaged sir on what we call sealed orders to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me said the captain
<s> so far so good
<s> but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i do
<s> i don t call that fair now do you
<s> no said dr
<s> livesey i don t
<s> next said the captain i learn we are going after treasure hear it from my own hands mind you
<s> now treasure is ticklish work i don t like treasure voyages on any account and i don t like them above all when they are secret and when begging your pardon mr
<s> trelawney the secret has been told to the parrot
<s> silver s parrot asked the squire
<s> it s a way of speaking said the captain
<s> blabbed i mean
<s> it s my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about but i ll tell you my way of it life or death and a close run
<s> that is all clear and i dare say true enough replied dr
<s> livesey
<s> we take the risk but we are not so ignorant as you believe us
<s> next you say you don t like the crew
<s> are they not good seamen
<s> i don t like them sir returned captain smollett
<s> and i think i should have had the choosing of my own hands if you go to that
<s> perhaps you should replied the doctor
<s> my friend should perhaps have taken you along with him but the slight if there be one was unintentional
<s> and you don t like mr
<s> arrow
<s> i don t sir
<s> i believe he s a good seaman but he s too free with the crew to be a good officer
<s> a mate should keep himself to himself shouldn t drink with the men before the mast
<s> do you mean he drinks cried the squire
<s> no sir replied the captain only that he s too familiar
<s> well now and the short and long of it captain asked the doctor
<s> tell us what you want
<s> well gentlemen are you determined to go on this cruise
<s> like iron answered the squire
<s> very good said the captain
<s> then as you ve heard me very patiently saying things that i could not prove hear me a few words more
<s> they are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold
<s> now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them there first point
<s> then you are bringing four of your own people with you and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward
<s> why not give them the berths here beside the cabin second point
<s> any more asked mr
<s> trelawney
<s> one more said the captain
<s> there s been too much blabbing already
<s> far too much agreed the doctor
<s> i ll tell you what i ve heard myself continued captain smollett that you have a map of an island that there s crosses on the map to show where treasure is and that the island lies and then he named the latitude and longitude exactly
<s> i never told that cried the squire to a soul
<s> the hands know it sir returned the captain
<s> livesey that must have been you or hawkins cried the squire
<s> it doesn t much matter who it was replied the doctor
<s> and i could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr
<s> trelawney s protestations
<s> neither did i to be sure he was so loose a talker yet in this case i believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island
<s> well gentlemen continued the captain i don t know who has this map but i make it a point it shall be kept secret even from me and mr
<s> arrow
<s> otherwise i would ask you to let me resign
<s> i see said the doctor
<s> you wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship manned with my friend s own people and provided with all the arms and powder on board
<s> in other words you fear a mutiny
<s> sir said captain smollett with no intention to take offence i deny your right to put words into my mouth
<s> no captain sir would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that
<s> as for mr
<s> arrow i believe him thoroughly honest some of the men are the same all may be for what i know
<s> but i am responsible for the ship s safety and the life of every man jack aboard of her
<s> i see things going as i think not quite right
<s> and i ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth
<s> and that s all
<s> captain smollett began the doctor with a smile did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse you ll excuse me i dare say but you remind me of that fable
<s> when you came in here i ll stake my wig you meant more than this
<s> doctor said the captain you are smart
<s> when i came in here i meant to get discharged
<s> i had no thought that mr
<s> trelawney would hear a word
<s> no more i would cried the squire
<s> had livesey not been here i should have seen you to the deuce
<s> as it is i have heard you
<s> i will do as you desire but i think the worse of you
<s> that s as you please sir said the captain
<s> you ll find i do my duty
<s> and with that he took his leave
<s> trelawney said the doctor contrary to all my notions i believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you that man and john silver
<s> silver if you like cried the squire but as for that intolerable humbug i declare i think his conduct unmanly unsailorly and downright un english
<s> well says the doctor we shall see
<s> when we came on deck the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder yo ho ing at their work while the captain and mr
<s> arrow stood by superintending
<s> the new arrangement was quite to my liking
<s> the whole schooner had been overhauled six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after part of the main hold and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side
<s> it had been originally meant that the captain mr
<s> arrow hunter joyce the doctor and the squire were to occupy these six berths
<s> now redruth and i were to get two of them and mr
<s> arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round house
<s> very low it was still of course but there was room to swing two hammocks and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement
<s> even he perhaps had been doubtful as to the crew but that is only guess for as you shall hear we had not long the benefit of his opinion
<s> we were all hard at work changing the powder and the berths when the last man or two and long john along with them came off in a shore boat
<s> the cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness and as soon as he saw what was doing so ho mates says he
<s> what s this
<s> we re a changing of the powder jack answers one
<s> why by the powers cried long john if we do we ll miss the morning tide
<s> my orders said the captain shortly
<s> you may go below my man
<s> hands will want supper
<s> aye aye sir answered the cook and touching his forelock he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley
<s> that s a good man captain said the doctor
<s> very likely sir replied captain smollett
<s> easy with that men easy he ran on to the fellows who were shifting the powder and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships a long brass nine here you ship s boy he cried out o that off with you to the cook and get some work
<s> 0103m
<s> and then as i was hurrying off i heard him say quite loudly to the doctor i ll have no favourites on my ship
<s> i assure you i was quite of the squire s way of thinking and hated the captain deeply
<s> 10
<s> 0106m
<s> the voyage
<s> 9106m
<s> ll that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place and boatfuls of the squire s friends mr
<s> blandly and the like coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return
<s> we never had a night at the admiral benbow when i had half the work and i was dog tired when a little before dawn the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan bars
<s> i might have been twice as weary yet i would not have left the deck all was so new and interesting to me the brief commands the shrill note of the whistle the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship s lanterns
<s> now barbecue tip us a stave cried one voice
<s> the old one cried another
<s> aye aye mates said long john who was standing by with his crutch under his arm and at once broke out in the air and words i knew so well
<s> fifteen men on the dead man s chest
<s> and then the whole crew bore chorus
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> and at the third ho drove the bars before them with a will
<s> even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old admiral benbow in a second and i seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus
<s> but soon the anchor was short up soon it was hanging dripping at the bows soon the sails began to draw and the land and shipping to flit by on either side and before i could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the hispaniola had begun her voyage to the isle of treasure
<s> i am not going to relate that voyage in detail
<s> it was fairly prosperous
<s> the ship proved to be a good ship the crew were capable seamen and the captain thoroughly understood his business
<s> but before we came the length of treasure island two or three things had happened which require to be known
<s> mr
<s> arrow first of all turned out even worse than the captain had feared
<s> he had no command among the men and people did what they pleased with him
<s> but that was by no means the worst of it for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye red cheeks stuttering tongue and other marks of drunkenness
<s> time after time he was ordered below in disgrace
<s> sometimes he fell and cut himself sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably
<s> in the meantime we could never make out where he got the drink
<s> that was the ship s mystery
<s> watch him as we pleased we could do nothing to solve it and when we asked him to his face he would only laugh if he were drunk and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water
<s> he was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright so nobody was much surprised nor very sorry when one dark night with a head sea he disappeared entirely and was seen no more
<s> overboard said the captain
<s> well gentlemen that saves the trouble of putting him in irons
<s> but there we were without a mate and it was necessary of course to advance one of the men
<s> the boatswain job anderson was the likeliest man aboard and though he kept his old title he served in a way as mate
<s> mr
<s> trelawney had followed the sea and his knowledge made him very useful for he often took a watch himself in easy weather
<s> and the coxswain israel hands was a careful wily old experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything
<s> he was a great confidant of long john silver and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship s cook barbecue as the men called him
<s> aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck to have both hands as free as possible
<s> it was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead and propped against it yielding to every movement of the ship get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore
<s> still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck
<s> he had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces long john s earrings they were called and he would hand himself from one place to another now using the crutch now trailing it alongside by the lanyard as quickly as another man could walk
<s> yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced
<s> he s no common man barbecue said the coxswain to me
<s> he had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded and brave a lion s nothing alongside of long john i seen him grapple four and knock their heads together him unarmed
<s> all the crew respected and even obeyed him
<s> he had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service
<s> to me he was unweariedly kind and always glad to see me in the galley which he kept as clean as a new pin the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner
<s> come away hawkins he would say come and have a yarn with john
<s> nobody more welcome than yourself my son
<s> sit you down and hear the news
<s> here s cap n flint i calls my parrot cap n flint after the famous buccaneer here s cap n flint predicting success to our v yage
<s> wasn t you cap n
<s> and the parrot would say with great rapidity pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight till you wondered that it was not out of breath or till john threw his handkerchief over the cage
<s> now that bird he would say is maybe two hundred years old hawkins they live forever mostly and if anybody s seen more wickedness it must be the devil himself
<s> she s sailed with england the great cap n england the pirate
<s> she s been at madagascar and at malabar and surinam and providence and portobello
<s> she was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships
<s> it s there she learned pieces of eight and little wonder three hundred and fifty thousand of em hawkins she was at the boarding of the viceroy of the indies out of goa she was and to look at her you would think she was a babby
<s> but you smelt powder didn t you cap n
<s> stand by to go about the parrot would scream
<s> ah she s a handsome craft she is the cook would say and give her sugar from his pocket and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on passing belief for wickedness
<s> there john would add you can t touch pitch and not be mucked lad
<s> here s this poor old innocent bird o mine swearing blue fire and none the wiser you may lay to that
<s> she would swear the same in a manner of speaking before chaplain
<s> and john would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men
<s> in the meantime the squire and captain smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another
<s> the squire made no bones about the matter he despised the captain
<s> the captain on his part never spoke but when he was spoken to and then sharp and short and dry and not a word wasted
<s> he owned when driven into a corner that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well
<s> as for the ship he had taken a downright fancy to her
<s> she ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife sir
<s> but he would add all i say is we re not home again and i don t like the cruise
<s> the squire at this would turn away and march up and down the deck chin in air
<s> a trifle more of that man he would say and i shall explode
<s> we had some heavy weather which only proved the qualities of the hispaniola
<s> every man on board seemed well content and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise for it is my belief there was never a ship s company so spoiled since noah put to sea
<s> double grog was going on the least excuse there was duff on odd days as for instance if the squire heard it was any man s birthday and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy
<s> never knew good come of it yet the captain said to dr
<s> livesey
<s> spoil forecastle hands make devils
<s> that s my belief
<s> but good did come of the apple barrel as you shall hear for if it had not been for that we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery
<s> this was how it came about
<s> we had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after i am not allowed to be more plain and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night
<s> it was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation some time that night or at latest before noon of the morrow we should sight the treasure island
<s> we were heading s
<s> s
<s> w
<s> and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea
<s> the hispaniola rolled steadily dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray
<s> all was drawing alow and aloft everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure
<s> now just after sundown when all my work was over and i was on my way to my berth it occurred to me that i should like an apple
<s> i ran on deck
<s> the watch was all forward looking out for the island
<s> the man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship
<s> 0111m
<s> in i got bodily into the apple barrel and found there was scarce an apple left but sitting down there in the dark what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship i had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by
<s> the barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it and i was just about to jump up when the man began to speak
<s> it was silver s voice and before i had heard a dozen words i would not have shown myself for all the world but lay there trembling and listening in the extreme of fear and curiosity for from these dozen words i understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone
<s> 11
<s> 0114m
<s> what i heard in the apple barrel
<s> 9114m
<s> o not i said silver
<s> flint was cap n i was quartermaster along of my timber leg
<s> the same broadside i lost my leg old pew lost his deadlights
<s> it was a master surgeon him that ampytated me out of college and all latin by the bucket and what not but he was hanged like a dog and sun dried like the rest at corso castle
<s> that was roberts men that was and comed of changing names to their ships royal fortune and so on
<s> now what a ship was christened so let her stay i says
<s> so it was with the cassandra as brought us all safe home from malabar after england took the viceroy of the indies so it was with the old walrus flint s old ship as i ve seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold
<s> ah cried another voice that of the youngest hand on board and evidently full of admiration
<s> he was the flower of the flock was flint
<s> davis was a man too by all accounts said silver
<s> i never sailed along of him first with england then with flint that s my story and now here on my own account in a manner of speaking
<s> i laid by nine hundred safe from england and two thousand after flint
<s> that ain t bad for a man before the mast all safe in bank
<s> tain t earning now it s saving does it you may lay to that
<s> where s all england s men now i dunno
<s> where s flint s why most on em aboard here and glad to get the duff been begging before that some on em
<s> old pew as had lost his sight and might have thought shame spends twelve hundred pound in a year like a lord in parliament
<s> where is he now well he s dead now and under hatches but for two year before that shiver my timbers the man was starving he begged and he stole and he cut throats and starved at that by the powers
<s> well it ain t much use after all said the young seaman
<s> tain t much use for fools you may lay to it that nor nothing cried silver
<s> but now you look here you re young you are but you re as smart as paint
<s> i see that when i set my eyes on you and i ll talk to you like a man
<s> you may imagine how i felt when i heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself
<s> i think if i had been able that i would have killed him through the barrel
<s> meantime he ran on little supposing he was overheard
<s> here it is about gentlemen of fortune
<s> they lives rough and they risk swinging but they eat and drink like fighting cocks and when a cruise is done why it s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets
<s> now the most goes for rum and a good fling and to sea again in their shirts
<s> but that s not the course i lay
<s> i puts it all away some here some there and none too much anywheres by reason of suspicion
<s> i m fifty mark you once back from this cruise i set up gentleman in earnest
<s> time enough too says you
<s> ah but i ve lived easy in the meantime never denied myself o nothing heart desires and slep soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea
<s> and how did i begin before the mast like you
<s> well said the other but all the other money s gone now ain t it you daren t show face in bristol after this
<s> why where might you suppose it was asked silver derisively
<s> at bristol in banks and places answered his companion
<s> it were said the cook it were when we weighed anchor
<s> but my old missis has it all by now
<s> and the spy glass is sold lease and goodwill and rigging and the old girl s off to meet me
<s> i would tell you where for i trust you but it d make jealousy among the mates
<s> and can you trust your missis asked the other
<s> gentlemen of fortune returned the cook usually trusts little among themselves and right they are you may lay to it
<s> but i have a way with me i have
<s> when a mate brings a slip on his cable one as knows me i mean it won t be in the same world with old john
<s> there was some that was feared of pew and some that was feared of flint but flint his own self was feared of me
<s> feared he was and proud
<s> they was the roughest crew afloat was flint s the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them
<s> well now i tell you i m not a boasting man and you seen yourself how easy i keep company but when i was quartermaster lambs wasn t the word for flint s old buccaneers
<s> ah you may be sure of yourself in old john s ship
<s> well i tell you now replied the lad i didn t half a quarter like the job till i had this talk with you john but there s my hand on it now
<s> and a brave lad you were and smart too answered silver shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune i never clapped my eyes on
<s> by this time i had begun to understand the meaning of their terms
<s> by a gentleman of fortune they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate and the little scene that i had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands perhaps of the last one left aboard
<s> but on this point i was soon to be relieved for silver giving a little whistle a third man strolled up and sat down by the party
<s> dick s square said silver
<s> oh i know d dick was square returned the voice of the coxswain israel hands
<s> he s no fool is dick
<s> and he turned his quid and spat
<s> but look here he went on here s what i want to know barbecue how long are we a going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat i ve had a most enough o cap n smollett he s hazed me long enough by thunder i want to go into that cabin i do
<s> i want their pickles and wines and that
<s> israel said silver your head ain t much account nor ever was
<s> but you re able to hear i reckon leastways your ears is big enough
<s> now here s what i say you ll berth forward and you ll live hard and you ll speak soft and you ll keep sober till i give the word and you may lay to that my son
<s> well i don t say no do i growled the coxswain
<s> what i say is when that s what i say
<s> when by the powers cried silver
<s> well now if you want to know i ll tell you when
<s> the last moment i can manage and that s when
<s> here s a first rate seaman cap n smollett sails the blessed ship for us
<s> here s this squire and doctor with a map and such i don t know where it is do i no more do you says you
<s> well then i mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff and help us to get it aboard by the powers
<s> then we ll see
<s> if i was sure of you all sons of double dutchmen i d have cap n smollett navigate us half way back again before i struck
<s> why we re all seamen aboard here i should think said the lad dick
<s> we re all forecastle hands you mean snapped silver
<s> we can steer a course but who s to set one that s what all you gentlemen split on first and last
<s> if i had my way i d have cap n smollett work us back into the trades at least then we d have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day
<s> but i know the sort you are
<s> i ll finish with em at the island as soon s the blunt s on board and a pity it is
<s> but you re never happy till you re drunk
<s> split my sides i ve a sick heart to sail with the likes of you
<s> easy all long john cried israel
<s> who s a crossin of you
<s> why how many tall ships think ye now have i seen laid aboard and how many brisk lads drying in the sun at execution dock cried silver
<s> and all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry
<s> you hear me i seen a thing or two at sea i have
<s> if you would on y lay your course and a p int to windward you would ride in carriages you would
<s> but not you i know you
<s> you ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow and go hang
<s> everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling john but there s others as could hand and steer as well as you said israel
<s> they liked a bit o fun they did
<s> they wasn t so high and dry nohow but took their fling like jolly companions every one
<s> so says silver
<s> well and where are they now pew was that sort and he died a beggar man
<s> flint was and he died of rum at savannah
<s> ah they was a sweet crew they was on y where are they
<s> but asked dick when we do lay em athwart what are we to do with em anyhow
<s> there s the man for me cried the cook admiringly
<s> that s what i call business
<s> well what would you think put em ashore like maroons that would have been england s way
<s> or cut em down like that much pork that would have been flint s or billy bones s
<s> billy was the man for that said israel
<s> dead men don t bite says he
<s> well he s dead now hisself he knows the long and short on it now and if ever a rough hand come to port it was billy
<s> right you are said silver rough and ready
<s> but mark you here i m an easy man i m quite the gentleman says you but this time it s serious
<s> dooty is dooty mates
<s> i give my vote death
<s> when i m in parlyment and riding in my coach i don t want none of these sea lawyers in the cabin a coming home unlooked for like the devil at prayers
<s> wait is what i say but when the time comes why let her rip
<s> john cries the coxswain you re a man
<s> you ll say so israel when you see said silver
<s> only one thing i claim i claim trelawney
<s> i ll wring his calf s head off his body with these hands dick he added breaking off
<s> you just jump up like a sweet lad and get me an apple to wet my pipe like
<s> you may fancy the terror i was in i should have leaped out and run for it if i had found the strength but my limbs and heart alike misgave me
<s> i heard dick begin to rise and then someone seemingly stopped him and the voice of hands exclaimed oh stow that don t you get sucking of that bilge john
<s> let s have a go of the rum
<s> dick said silver i trust you
<s> i ve a gauge on the keg mind
<s> there s the key you fill a pannikin and bring it up
<s> terrified as i was i could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how mr
<s> arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him
<s> dick was gone but a little while and during his absence israel spoke straight on in the cook s ear
<s> it was but a word or two that i could catch and yet i gathered some important news for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose this whole clause was audible not another man of them ll jine
<s> hence there were still faithful men on board
<s> when dick returned one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank one to luck another with a here s to old flint and silver himself saying in a kind of song here s to ourselves and hold your luff plenty of prizes and plenty of duff
<s> 0117m
<s> just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel and looking up i found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen top and shining white on the luff of the fore sail and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted land ho
<s> 12
<s> 0122m
<s> council of war
<s> 9122m
<s> here was a great rush of feet across the deck
<s> i could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle and slipping in an instant outside my barrel i dived behind the fore sail made a double towards the stern and came out upon the open deck in time to join hunter and dr
<s> livesey in the rush for the weather bow
<s> there all hands were already congregated
<s> a belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon
<s> away to the south west of us we saw two low hills about a couple of miles apart and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill whose peak was still buried in the fog
<s> all three seemed sharp and conical in figure
<s> so much i saw almost in a dream for i had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before
<s> and then i heard the voice of captain smollett issuing orders
<s> the hispaniola was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east
<s> and now men said the captain when all was sheeted home has any one of you ever seen that land ahead
<s> i have sir said silver
<s> i ve watered there with a trader i was cook in
<s> the anchorage is on the south behind an islet i fancy asked the captain
<s> yes sir skeleton island they calls it
<s> it were a main place for pirates once and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it
<s> that hill to the nor ard they calls the fore mast hill there are three hills in a row running south ard fore main and mizzen sir
<s> but the main that s the big un with the cloud on it they usually calls the spy glass by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning for it s there they cleaned their ships sir asking your pardon
<s> i have a chart here says captain smollett
<s> see if that s the place
<s> long john s eyes burned in his head as he took the chart but by the fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment
<s> this was not the map we found in billy bones s chest but an accurate copy complete in all things names and heights and soundings with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes
<s> sharp as must have been his annoyance silver had the strength of mind to hide it
<s> yes sir said he this is the spot to be sure and very prettily drawed out
<s> who might have done that i wonder the pirates were too ignorant i reckon
<s> aye here it is capt
<s> kidd s anchorage just the name my shipmate called it
<s> there s a strong current runs along the south and then away nor ard up the west coast
<s> right you was sir says he to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island
<s> leastways if such was your intention as to enter and careen and there ain t no better place for that in these waters
<s> thank you my man says captain smollett
<s> i ll ask you later on to give us a help
<s> you may go
<s> i was surprised at the coolness with which john avowed his knowledge of the island and i own i was half frightened when i saw him drawing nearer to myself
<s> he did not know to be sure that i had overheard his council from the apple barrel and yet i had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty duplicity and power that i could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm
<s> ah says he this here is a sweet spot this island a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on
<s> you ll bathe and you ll climb trees and you ll hunt goats you will and you ll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself
<s> why it makes me young again
<s> i was going to forget my timber leg i was
<s> it s a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes and you may lay to that
<s> when you want to go a bit of exploring you just ask old john and he ll put up a snack for you to take along
<s> and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder he hobbled off forward and went below
<s> captain smollett the squire and dr
<s> livesey were talking together on the quarter deck and anxious as i was to tell them my story i durst not interrupt them openly
<s> while i was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse dr
<s> livesey called me to his side
<s> he had left his pipe below and being a slave to tobacco had meant that i should fetch it but as soon as i was near enough to speak and not to be overheard i broke immediately doctor let me speak
<s> get the captain and squire down to the cabin and then make some pretence to send for me
<s> i have terrible news
<s> the doctor changed countenance a little but next moment he was master of himself
<s> thank you jim said he quite loudly that was all i wanted to know as if he had asked me a question
<s> and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two
<s> they spoke together for a little and though none of them started or raised his voice or so much as whistled it was plain enough that dr
<s> livesey had communicated my request for the next thing that i heard was the captain giving an order to job anderson and all hands were piped on deck
<s> my lads said captain smollett i ve a word to say to you
<s> this land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for
<s> mr
<s> trelawney being a very open handed gentleman as we all know has just asked me a word or two and as i was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty alow and aloft as i never ask to see it done better why he and i and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink your health and luck and you ll have grog served out for you to drink our health and luck
<s> i ll tell you what i think of this i think it handsome
<s> and if you think as i do you ll give a good sea cheer for the gentleman that does it
<s> the cheer followed that was a matter of course but it rang out so full and hearty that i confess i could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood
<s> one more cheer for cap n smollett cried long john when the first had subsided
<s> 0125m
<s> and this also was given with a will
<s> on the top of that the three gentlemen went below and not long after word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin
<s> i found them all three seated round the table a bottle of spanish wine and some raisins before them and the doctor smoking away with his wig on his lap and that i knew was a sign that he was agitated
<s> the stern window was open for it was a warm night and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship s wake
<s> now hawkins said the squire you have something to say
<s> speak up
<s> i did as i was bid and as short as i could make it told the whole details of silver s conversation
<s> nobody interrupted me till i was done nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last
<s> jim said dr
<s> livesey take a seat
<s> and they made me sit down at table beside them poured me out a glass of wine filled my hands with raisins and all three one after the other and each with a bow drank my good health and their service to me for my luck and courage
<s> now captain said the squire you were right and i was wrong
<s> i own myself an ass and i await your orders
<s> no more an ass than i sir returned the captain
<s> i never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according
<s> but this crew he added beats me
<s> captain said the doctor with your permission that s silver
<s> a very remarkable man
<s> he d look remarkably well from a yard arm sir returned the captain
<s> but this is talk this don t lead to anything
<s> i see three or four points and with mr
<s> trelawney s permission i ll name them
<s> you sir are the captain
<s> it is for you to speak says mr
<s> trelawney grandly
<s> first point began mr
<s> smollett
<s> we must go on because we can t turn back
<s> if i gave the word to go about they would rise at once
<s> second point we have time before us at least until this treasure s found
<s> third point there are faithful hands
<s> now sir it s got to come to blows sooner or later and what i propose is to take time by the forelock as the saying is and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it
<s> we can count i take it on your own home servants mr
<s> trelawney
<s> as upon myself declared the squire
<s> three reckoned the captain ourselves make seven counting hawkins here
<s> now about the honest hands
<s> most likely trelawney s own men said the doctor those he had picked up for himself before he lit on silver
<s> nay replied the squire
<s> hands was one of mine
<s> i did think i could have trusted hands added the captain
<s> and to think that they re all englishmen broke out the squire
<s> sir i could find it in my heart to blow the ship up
<s> well gentlemen said the captain the best that i can say is not much
<s> we must lay to if you please and keep a bright lookout
<s> it s trying on a man i know
<s> it would be pleasanter to come to blows
<s> but there s no help for it till we know our men
<s> lay to and whistle for a wind that s my view
<s> jim here said the doctor can help us more than anyone
<s> the men are not shy with him and jim is a noticing lad
<s> hawkins i put prodigious faith in you added the squire
<s> i began to feel pretty desperate at this for i felt altogether helpless and yet by an odd train of circumstances it was indeed through me that safety came
<s> in the meantime talk as we pleased there were only seven out of the twenty six on whom we knew we could rely and out of these seven one was a boy so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen
<s> 0131m
<s> part three my shore adventure
<s> 13
<s> 0133m
<s> how my shore adventure began
<s> 9133m
<s> he appearance of the island when i came on deck next morning was altogether changed
<s> although the breeze had now utterly ceased we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south east of the low eastern coast
<s> grey coloured woods covered a large part of the surface
<s> this even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand break in the lower lands and by many tall trees of the pine family out topping the others some singly some in clumps but the general colouring was uniform and sad
<s> the hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock
<s> all were strangely shaped and the spy glass which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island was likewise the strangest in configuration running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on
<s> the hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell
<s> the booms were tearing at the blocks the rudder was banging to and fro and the whole ship creaking groaning and jumping like a manufactory
<s> i had to cling tight to the backstay and the world turned giddily before my eyes for though i was a good enough sailor when there was way on this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing i never learned to stand without a qualm or so above all in the morning on an empty stomach
<s> perhaps it was this perhaps it was the look of the island with its grey melancholy woods and wild stone spires and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach at least although the sun shone bright and hot and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea my heart sank as the saying is into my boots and from the first look onward i hated the very thought of treasure island
<s> we had a dreary morning s work before us for there was no sign of any wind and the boats had to be got out and manned and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind skeleton island
<s> i volunteered for one of the boats where i had of course no business
<s> the heat was sweltering and the men grumbled fiercely over their work
<s> anderson was in command of my boat and instead of keeping the crew in order he grumbled as loud as the worst
<s> well he said with an oath it s not forever
<s> i thought this was a very bad sign for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline
<s> all the way in long john stood by the steersman and conned the ship
<s> he knew the passage like the palm of his hand and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart john never hesitated once
<s> there s a strong scour with the ebb he said and this here passage has been dug out in a manner of speaking with a spade
<s> we brought up just where the anchor was in the chart about a third of a mile from each shore the mainland on one side and skeleton island on the other
<s> the bottom was clean sand
<s> the plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent
<s> the place was entirely land locked buried in woods the trees coming right down to high water mark the shores mostly flat and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre one here one there
<s> two little rivers or rather two swamps emptied out into this pond as you might call it and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness
<s> from the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade for they were quite buried among trees and if it had not been for the chart on the companion we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas
<s> there was not a breath of air moving nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside
<s> a peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks
<s> i observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing like someone tasting a bad egg
<s> i don t know about treasure he said but i ll stake my wig there s fever here
<s> if the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat it became truly threatening when they had come aboard
<s> they lay about the deck growling together in talk
<s> the slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed
<s> even the honest hands must have caught the infection for there was not one man aboard to mend another
<s> mutiny it was plain hung over us like a thunder cloud
<s> and it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger
<s> long john was hard at work going from group to group spending himself in good advice and as for example no man could have shown a better
<s> he fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility he was all smiles to everyone
<s> if an order were given john would be on his crutch in an instant with the cheeriest aye aye sir in the world and when there was nothing else to do he kept up one song after another as if to conceal the discontent of the rest
<s> of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon this obvious anxiety on the part of long john appeared the worst
<s> we held a council in the cabin
<s> sir said the captain if i risk another order the whole ship ll come about our ears by the run
<s> you see sir here it is
<s> i get a rough answer do i not well if i speak back pikes will be going in two shakes if i don t silver will see there s something under that and the game s up
<s> now we ve only one man to rely on
<s> and who is that asked the squire
<s> silver sir returned the captain he s as anxious as you and i to smother things up
<s> this is a tiff he d soon talk em out of it if he had the chance and what i propose to do is to give him the chance
<s> let s allow the men an afternoon ashore
<s> if they all go why we ll fight the ship
<s> if they none of them go well then we hold the cabin and god defend the right
<s> if some go you mark my words sir silver ll bring em aboard again as mild as lambs
<s> it was so decided loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men hunter joyce and redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew
<s> my lads said he we ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts
<s> a turn ashore ll hurt nobody the boats are still in the water you can take the gigs and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon
<s> i ll fire a gun half an hour before sundown
<s> i believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage
<s> the captain was too bright to be in the way
<s> he whipped out of sight in a moment leaving silver to arrange the party and i fancy it was as well he did so
<s> had he been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation
<s> it was as plain as day
<s> silver was the captain and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it
<s> the honest hands and i was soon to see it proved that there were such on board must have been very stupid fellows
<s> or rather i suppose the truth was this that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders only some more some less and a few being good fellows in the main could neither be led nor driven any further
<s> it is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men
<s> at last however the party was made up
<s> six fellows were to stay on board and the remaining thirteen including silver began to embark
<s> then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives
<s> if six men were left by silver it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship and since only six were left it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance
<s> it occurred to me at once to go ashore
<s> in a jiffy i had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore sheets of the nearest boat and almost at the same moment she shoved off
<s> no one took notice of me only the bow oar saying is that you jim keep your head down
<s> but silver from the other boat looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me and from that moment i began to regret what i had done
<s> 0137m
<s> the crews raced for the beach but the boat i was in having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned shot far ahead of her consort and the bow had struck among the shore side trees and i had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind
<s> jim jim i heard him shouting
<s> but you may suppose i paid no heed jumping ducking and breaking through i ran straight before my nose till i could run no longer
<s> 14
<s> 0140m
<s> the first blow
<s> 9140m
<s> was so pleased at having given the slip to long john that i began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that i was in
<s> i had crossed a marshy tract full of willows bulrushes and odd outlandish swampy trees and i had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating sandy country about a mile long dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees not unlike the oak in growth but pale in the foliage like willows
<s> on the far side of the open stood one of the hills with two quaint craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun
<s> i now felt for the first time the joy of exploration
<s> the isle was uninhabited my shipmates i had left behind and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls
<s> i turned hither and thither among the trees
<s> here and there were flowering plants unknown to me here and there i saw snakes and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top
<s> little did i suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle
<s> then i came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees live or evergreen oaks i heard afterwards they should be called which grew low along the sand like brambles the boughs curiously twisted the foliage compact like thatch
<s> the thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls spreading and growing taller as it went until it reached the margin of the broad reedy fen through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage
<s> the marsh was steaming in the strong sun and the outline of the spy glass trembled through the haze
<s> all at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes a wild duck flew up with a quack another followed and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air
<s> i judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen
<s> nor was i deceived for soon i heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice which as i continued to give ear grew steadily louder and nearer
<s> this put me in a great fear and i crawled under cover of the nearest live oak and squatted there hearkening as silent as a mouse
<s> another voice answered and then the first voice which i now recognized to be silver s once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream only now and again interrupted by the other
<s> by the sound they must have been talking earnestly and almost fiercely but no distinct word came to my hearing
<s> at last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down for not only did they cease to draw any nearer but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp
<s> and now i began to feel that i was neglecting my business that since i had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes the least i could do was to overhear them at their councils and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as i could manage under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees
<s> i could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders
<s> crawling on all fours i made steadily but slowly towards them till at last raising my head to an aperture among the leaves i could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh and closely set about with trees where long john silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation
<s> the sun beat full upon them
<s> silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground and his great smooth blond face all shining with heat was lifted to the other man s in a kind of appeal
<s> mate he was saying it s because i thinks gold dust of you gold dust and you may lay to that if i hadn t took to you like pitch do you think i d have been here a warning of you all s up you can t make nor mend it s to save your neck that i m a speaking and if one of the wild uns knew it where d i be tom now tell me where d i be
<s> silver said the other man and i observed he was not only red in the face but spoke as hoarse as a crow and his voice shook too like a taut rope silver says he you re old and you re honest or has the name for it and you ve money too which lots of poor sailors hasn t and you re brave or i m mistook
<s> and will you tell me you ll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs not you as sure as god sees me i d sooner lose my hand
<s> if i turn agin my dooty
<s> and then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise
<s> i had found one of the honest hands well here at that same moment came news of another
<s> far away out in the marsh there arose all of a sudden a sound like the cry of anger then another on the back of it and then one horrid long drawn scream
<s> the rocks of the spy glass re echoed it a score of times the whole troop of marsh birds rose again darkening heaven with a simultaneous whirr and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain silence had re established its empire and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon
<s> tom had leaped at the sound like a horse at the spur but silver had not winked an eye
<s> he stood where he was resting lightly on his crutch watching his companion like a snake about to spring
<s> john said the sailor stretching out his hand
<s> hands off cried silver leaping back a yard as it seemed to me with the speed and security of a trained gymnast
<s> hands off if you like john silver said the other
<s> it s a black conscience that can make you feared of me
<s> but in heaven s name tell me what was that
<s> that returned silver smiling away but warier than ever his eye a mere pin point in his big face but gleaming like a crumb of glass
<s> that oh i reckon that ll be alan
<s> and at this point tom flashed out like a hero
<s> alan he cried
<s> then rest his soul for a true seaman and as for you john silver long you ve been a mate of mine but you re mate of mine no more
<s> if i die like a dog i ll die in my dooty
<s> you ve killed alan have you kill me too if you can
<s> but i defies you
<s> and with that this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach
<s> but he was not destined to go far
<s> with a cry john seized the branch of a tree whipped the crutch out of his armpit and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air
<s> it struck poor tom point foremost and with stunning violence right between the shoulders in the middle of his back
<s> his hands flew up he gave a sort of gasp and fell
<s> whether he were injured much or little none could ever tell
<s> like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot
<s> but he had no time given him to recover
<s> silver agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body
<s> from my place of ambush i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows
<s> i do not know what it rightly is to faint but i do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist silver and the birds and the tall spy glass hilltop going round and round and topsy turvy before my eyes and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear
<s> when i came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together his crutch under his arm his hat upon his head
<s> just before him tom lay motionless upon the sward but the murderer minded him not a whit cleansing his blood stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass
<s> everything else was unchanged the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain and i could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes
<s> 0141m
<s> 0145m
<s> but now john put his hand into his pocket brought out a whistle and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air
<s> i could not tell of course the meaning of the signal but it instantly awoke my fears
<s> more men would be coming
<s> i might be discovered
<s> they had already slain two of the honest people after tom and alan might not i come next
<s> instantly i began to extricate myself and crawl back again with what speed and silence i could manage to the more open portion of the wood
<s> as i did so i could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades and this sound of danger lent me wings
<s> as soon as i was clear of the thicket i ran as i never ran before scarce minding the direction of my flight so long as it led me from the murderers and as i ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy
<s> indeed could anyone be more entirely lost than i when the gun fired how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends still smoking from their crime would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe s would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge it was all over i thought
<s> good bye to the hispaniola good bye to the squire the doctor and the captain there was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers
<s> all this while as i say i was still running and without taking any notice i had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions
<s> mingled with these were a few scattered pines some fifty some nearer seventy feet high
<s> the air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh
<s> and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart
<s> 15
<s> 0150m
<s> the man of the island
<s> 9150m
<s> rom the side of the hill which was here steep and stony a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees
<s> my eyes turned instinctively in that direction and i saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine
<s> what it was whether bear or man or monkey i could in no wise tell
<s> it seemed dark and shaggy more i knew not
<s> but the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand
<s> i was now it seemed cut off upon both sides behind me the murderers before me this lurking nondescript
<s> and immediately i began to prefer the dangers that i knew to those i knew not
<s> silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods and i turned on my heel and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats
<s> instantly the figure reappeared and making a wide circuit began to head me off
<s> i was tired at any rate but had i been as fresh as when i rose i could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary
<s> from trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer running manlike on two legs but unlike any man that i had ever seen stooping almost double as it ran
<s> yet a man it was i could no longer be in doubt about that
<s> i began to recall what i had heard of cannibals
<s> i was within an ace of calling for help
<s> but the mere fact that he was a man however wild had somewhat reassured me and my fear of silver began to revive in proportion
<s> i stood still therefore and cast about for some method of escape and as i was so thinking the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind
<s> as soon as i remembered i was not defenceless courage glowed again in my heart and i set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him
<s> he was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk but he must have been watching me closely for as soon as i began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me
<s> then he hesitated drew back came forward again and at last to my wonder and confusion threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication
<s> at that i once more stopped
<s> who are you i asked
<s> ben gunn he answered and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward like a rusty lock
<s> i m poor ben gunn i am and i haven t spoke with a christian these three years
<s> 0153m
<s> i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing
<s> his skin wherever it was exposed was burnt by the sun even his lips were black and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face
<s> of all the beggar men that i had seen or fancied he was the chief for raggedness
<s> he was clothed with tatters of old ship s canvas and old sea cloth and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings brass buttons bits of stick and loops of tarry gaskin
<s> about his waist he wore an old brass buckled leather belt which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement
<s> three years i cried
<s> were you shipwrecked
<s> nay mate said he marooned
<s> i had heard the word and i knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island
<s> marooned three years agone he continued and lived on goats since then and berries and oysters
<s> wherever a man is says i a man can do for himself
<s> but mate my heart is sore for christian diet
<s> you mightn t happen to have a piece of cheese about you now no well many s the long night i ve dreamed of cheese toasted mostly and woke up again and here i were
<s> if ever i can get aboard again said i you shall have cheese by the stone
<s> all this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket smoothing my hands looking at my boots and generally in the intervals of his speech showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature
<s> but at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness
<s> if ever you can get aboard again says you he repeated
<s> why now who s to hinder you
<s> not you i know was my reply
<s> and right you was he cried
<s> now you what do you call yourself mate
<s> jim i told him
<s> jim jim says he quite pleased apparently
<s> well now jim i ve lived that rough as you d be ashamed to hear of
<s> now for instance you wouldn t think i had had a pious mother to look at me he asked
<s> why no not in particular i answered
<s> ah well said he but i had remarkable pious
<s> and i was a civil pious boy and could rattle off my catechism that fast as you couldn t tell one word from another
<s> and here s what it come to jim and it begun with chuck farthen on the blessed grave stones that s what it begun with but it went further n that and so my mother told me and predicked the whole she did the pious woman but it were providence that put me here
<s> i ve thought it all out in this here lonely island and i m back on piety
<s> you don t catch me tasting rum so much but just a thimbleful for luck of course the first chance i have
<s> i m bound i ll be good and i see the way to
<s> and jim looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper i m rich
<s> i now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude and i suppose i must have shown the feeling in my face for he repeated the statement hotly rich rich i says
<s> and i ll tell you what i ll make a man of you jim
<s> ah jim you ll bless your stars you will you was the first that found me
<s> and at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes
<s> now jim you tell me true that ain t flint s ship he asked
<s> at this i had a happy inspiration
<s> i began to believe that i had found an ally and i answered him at once
<s> it s not flint s ship and flint is dead but i ll tell you true as you ask me there are some of flint s hands aboard worse luck for the rest of us
<s> not a man with one leg he gasped
<s> silver i asked
<s> ah silver says he
<s> that were his name
<s> he s the cook and the ringleader too
<s> he was still holding me by the wrist and at that he give it quite a wring
<s> if you was sent by long john he said i m as good as pork and i know it
<s> but where was you do you suppose
<s> i had made my mind up in a moment and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves
<s> he heard me with the keenest interest and when i had done he patted me on the head
<s> you re a good lad jim he said and you re all in a clove hitch ain t you well you just put your trust in ben gunn ben gunn s the man to do it
<s> would you think it likely now that your squire would prove a liberal minded one in case of help him being in a clove hitch as you remark
<s> i told him the squire was the most liberal of men
<s> aye but you see returned ben gunn i didn t mean giving me a gate to keep and a suit of livery clothes and such that s not my mark jim
<s> what i mean is would he be likely to come down to the toon of say one thousand pounds out of money that s as good as a man s own already
<s> i am sure he would said i
<s> as it was all hands were to share
<s> and a passage home he added with a look of great shrewdness
<s> why i cried the squire s a gentleman
<s> and besides if we got rid of the others we should want you to help work the vessel home
<s> ah said he so you would
<s> and he seemed very much relieved
<s> now i ll tell you what he went on
<s> so much i ll tell you and no more
<s> i were in flint s ship when he buried the treasure he and six along six strong seamen
<s> they was ashore nigh on a week and us standing off and on in the old walrus
<s> one fine day up went the signal and here come flint by himself in a little boat and his head done up in a blue scarf
<s> the sun was getting up and mortal white he looked about the cutwater
<s> but there he was you mind and the six all dead dead and buried
<s> how he done it not a man aboard us could make out
<s> it was battle murder and sudden death leastways him against six
<s> billy bones was the mate long john he was quartermaster and they asked him where the treasure was
<s> ah says he you can go ashore if you like and stay he says but as for the ship she ll beat up for more by thunder that s what he said
<s> well i was in another ship three years back and we sighted this island
<s> boys said i here s flint s treasure let s land and find it
<s> the cap n was displeased at that but my messmates were all of a mind and landed
<s> twelve days they looked for it and every day they had the worse word for me until one fine morning all hands went aboard
<s> as for you benjamin gunn says they here s a musket they says and a spade and pick axe
<s> you can stay here and find flint s money for yourself they says
<s> well jim three years have i been here and not a bite of christian diet from that day to this
<s> but now you look here look at me
<s> do i look like a man before the mast no says you
<s> nor i weren t neither i says
<s> and with that he winked and pinched me hard
<s> just you mention them words to your squire jim he went on
<s> nor he weren t neither that s the words
<s> three years he were the man of this island light and dark fair and rain and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer says you and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother so be as she s alive you ll say but the most part of gunn s time this is what you ll say the most part of his time was took up with another matter
<s> and then you ll give him a nip like i do
<s> and he pinched me again in the most confidential manner
<s> then he continued then you ll up and you ll say this gunn is a good man you ll say and he puts a precious sight more confidence a precious sight mind that in a gen leman born than in these gen leman of fortune having been one hisself
<s> well i said i don t understand one word that you ve been saying
<s> but that s neither here nor there for how am i to get on board
<s> ah said he that s the hitch for sure
<s> well there s my boat that i made with my two hands
<s> i keep her under the white rock
<s> if the worst come to the worst we might try that after dark
<s> hi he broke out
<s> what s that
<s> for just then although the sun had still an hour or two to run all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon
<s> they have begun to fight i cried
<s> follow me
<s> and i began to run towards the anchorage my terrors all forgotten while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly
<s> left left says he keep to your left hand mate jim under the trees with you theer s where i killed my first goat
<s> they don t come down here now they re all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of benjamin gunn
<s> ah and there s the cetemery cemetery he must have meant
<s> you see the mounds i come here and prayed nows and thens when i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo
<s> it weren t quite a chapel but it seemed more solemn like and then says you ben gunn was short handed no chapling nor so much as a bible and a flag you says
<s> so he kept talking as i ran neither expecting nor receiving any answer
<s> the cannon shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms
<s> another pause and then not a quarter of a mile in front of me i beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood
<s> 0159m
<s> part four the stockade
<s> 16
<s> 0161m
<s> narrative continued by the doctor how the ship was abandoned
<s> 9161m
<s> t was about half past one three bells in the sea phrase that the two boats went ashore from the hispaniola
<s> the captain the squire and i were talking matters over in the cabin
<s> had there been a breath of wind we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us slipped our cable and away to sea
<s> but the wind was wanting and to complete our helplessness down came hunter with the news that jim hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest
<s> it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins but we were alarmed for his safety
<s> with the men in the temper they were in it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again
<s> we ran on deck
<s> the pitch was bubbling in the seams the nasty stench of the place turned me sick if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery it was in that abominable anchorage
<s> the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each hard by where the river runs in
<s> one of them was whistling lillibullero
<s> waiting was a strain and it was decided that hunter and i should go ashore with the jolly boat in quest of information
<s> the gigs had leaned to their right but hunter and i pulled straight in in the direction of the stockade upon the chart
<s> the two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance lillibullero stopped off and i could see the pair discussing what they ought to do
<s> had they gone and told silver all might have turned out differently but they had their orders i suppose and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to lillibullero
<s> there was a slight bend in the coast and i steered so as to put it between us even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs
<s> i jumped out and came as near running as i durst with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety
<s> i had not gone a hundred yards when i reached the stockade
<s> this was how it was a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll
<s> well on the knoll and enclosing the spring they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side
<s> all round this they had cleared a wide space and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high without door or opening too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers
<s> the people in the log house had them in every way they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges
<s> all they wanted was a good watch and food for short of a complete surprise they might have held the place against a regiment
<s> what particularly took my fancy was the spring
<s> for though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola with plenty of arms and ammunition and things to eat and excellent wines there had been one thing overlooked we had no water
<s> i was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death
<s> i was not new to violent death i have served his royal highness the duke of cumberland and got a wound myself at fontenoy but i know my pulse went dot and carry one
<s> jim hawkins is gone was my first thought
<s> it is something to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor
<s> there is no time to dilly dally in our work
<s> and so now i made up my mind instantly and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly boat
<s> by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar
<s> we made the water fly and the boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner
<s> i found them all shaken as was natural
<s> the squire was sitting down as white as a sheet thinking of the harm he had led us to the good soul and one of the six forecastle hands was little better
<s> there s a man says captain smollett nodding towards him new to this work
<s> he came nigh hand fainting doctor when he heard the cry
<s> another touch of the rudder and that man would join us
<s> i told my plan to the captain and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment
<s> we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection
<s> hunter brought the boat round under the stern port and joyce and i set to work loading her with powder tins muskets bags of biscuits kegs of pork a cask of cognac and my invaluable medicine chest
<s> in the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on deck and the latter hailed the coxswain who was the principal man aboard
<s> mr
<s> hands he said here are two of us with a brace of pistols each
<s> if any one of you six make a signal of any description that man s dead
<s> they were a good deal taken aback and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion thinking no doubt to take us on the rear
<s> but when they saw redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley they went about ship at once and a head popped out again on deck
<s> down dog cries the captain
<s> and the head popped back again and we heard no more for the time of these six very faint hearted seamen
<s> 0163m
<s> by this time tumbling things in as they came we had the jolly boat loaded as much as we dared
<s> joyce and i got out through the stern port and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us
<s> this second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore
<s> lillibullero was dropped again and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point one of them whipped ashore and disappeared
<s> i had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats but i feared that silver and the others might be close at hand and all might very well be lost by trying for too much
<s> we had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house
<s> all three made the first journey heavily laden and tossed our stores over the palisade
<s> then leaving joyce to guard them one man to be sure but with half a dozen muskets hunter and i returned to the jolly boat and loaded ourselves once more
<s> so we proceeded without pausing to take breath till the whole cargo was bestowed when the two servants took up their position in the block house and i with all my power sculled back to the hispaniola
<s> that we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was
<s> they had the advantage of numbers of course but we had the advantage of arms
<s> not one of the men ashore had a musket and before they could get within range for pistol shooting we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half dozen at least
<s> the squire was waiting for me at the stern window all his faintness gone from him
<s> he caught the painter and made it fast and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives
<s> pork powder and biscuit was the cargo with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and redruth and the captain
<s> the rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun on the clean sandy bottom
<s> by this time the tide was beginning to ebb and the ship was swinging round to her anchor
<s> voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs and though this reassured us for joyce and hunter who were well to the eastward it warned our party to be off
<s> redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat which we then brought round to the ship s counter to be handier for captain smollett
<s> now men said he do you hear me
<s> there was no answer from the forecastle
<s> it s to you abraham gray it s to you i am speaking
<s> still no reply
<s> gray resumed mr
<s> smollett a little louder i am leaving this ship and i order you to follow your captain
<s> i know you are a good man at bottom and i dare say not one of the lot of you s as bad as he makes out
<s> i have my watch here in my hand i give you thirty seconds to join me in
<s> there was a pause
<s> come my fine fellow continued the captain don t hang so long in stays
<s> i m risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second
<s> there was a sudden scuffle a sound of blows and out burst abraham gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle
<s> i m with you sir said he
<s> and the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us and we had shoved off and given way
<s> we were clear out of the ship but not yet ashore in our stockade
<s> 17
<s> 0168m
<s> narrative continued by the doctor the jolly boat s last trip
<s> 9168m
<s> his fifth trip was quite different from any of the others
<s> in the first place the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded
<s> five grown men and three of them trelawney redruth and the captain over six feet high was already more than she was meant to carry
<s> add to that the powder pork and bread bags
<s> the gunwale was lipping astern
<s> several times we shipped a little water and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards
<s> the captain made us trim the boat and we got her to lie a little more evenly
<s> all the same we were afraid to breathe
<s> in the second place the ebb was now making a strong rippling current running westward through the basin and then south ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning
<s> even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing place behind the point
<s> if we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs where the pirates might appear at any moment
<s> i cannot keep her head for the stockade sir said i to the captain
<s> i was steering while he and redruth two fresh men were at the oars
<s> the tide keeps washing her down
<s> could you pull a little stronger
<s> not without swamping the boat said he
<s> you must bear up sir if you please bear up until you see you re gaining
<s> i tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until i had laid her head due east or just about right angles to the way we ought to go
<s> we ll never get ashore at this rate said i
<s> if it s the only course that we can lie sir we must even lie it returned the captain
<s> we must keep upstream
<s> you see sir he went on if once we dropped to leeward of the landing place it s hard to say where we should get ashore besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs whereas the way we go the current must slacken and then we can dodge back along the shore
<s> the current s less a ready sir said the man gray who was sitting in the fore sheets you can ease her off a bit
<s> thank you my man said i quite as if nothing had happened for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves
<s> suddenly the captain spoke up again and i thought his voice was a little changed
<s> the gun said he
<s> i have thought of that said i for i made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort
<s> they could never get the gun ashore and if they did they could never haul it through the woods
<s> look astern doctor replied the captain
<s> we had entirely forgotten the long nine and there to our horror were the five rogues busy about her getting off her jacket as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed
<s> not only that but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad
<s> israel was flint s gunner said gray hoarsely
<s> at any risk we put the boat s head direct for the landing place
<s> by this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing and i could keep her steady for the goal
<s> but the worst of it was that with the course i now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the hispaniola and offered a target like a barn door
<s> i could hear as well as see that brandy faced rascal israel hands plumping down a round shot on the deck
<s> who s the best shot asked the captain
<s> mr
<s> trelawney out and away said i
<s> mr
<s> trelawney will you please pick me off one of these men sir hands if possible said the captain
<s> trelawney was as cool as steel
<s> he looked to the priming of his gun
<s> now cried the captain easy with that gun sir or you ll swamp the boat
<s> all hands stand by to trim her when he aims
<s> the squire raised his gun the rowing ceased and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop
<s> they had the gun by this time slewed round upon the swivel and hands who was at the muzzle with the rammer was in consequence the most exposed
<s> however we had no luck for just as trelawney fired down he stooped the ball whistled over him and it was one of the other four who fell
<s> the cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore and looking in that direction i saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats
<s> here come the gigs sir said i
<s> give way then cried the captain
<s> we mustn t mind if we swamp her now
<s> if we can t get ashore all s up
<s> only one of the gigs is being manned sir i added the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off
<s> they ll have a hot run sir returned the captain
<s> jack ashore you know
<s> it s not them i mind it s the round shot
<s> carpet bowls my lady s maid couldn t miss
<s> tell us squire when you see the match and we ll hold water
<s> 0171m
<s> in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded and we had shipped but little water in the process
<s> we were now close in thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees
<s> the gig was no longer to be feared the little point had already concealed it from our eyes
<s> the ebb tide which had so cruelly delayed us was now making reparation and delaying our assailants
<s> the one source of danger was the gun
<s> if i durst said the captain i d stop and pick off another man
<s> but it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot
<s> they had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade though he was not dead and i could see him trying to crawl away
<s> ready cried the squire
<s> hold cried the captain quick as an echo
<s> and he and redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water
<s> the report fell in at the same instant of time
<s> this was the first that jim heard the sound of the squire s shot not having reached him
<s> where the ball passed not one of us precisely knew but i fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster
<s> at any rate the boat sank by the stern quite gently in three feet of water leaving the captain and myself facing each other on our feet
<s> the other three took complete headers and came up again drenched and bubbling
<s> so far there was no great harm
<s> no lives were lost and we could wade ashore in safety
<s> but there were all our stores at the bottom and to make things worse only two guns out of five remained in a state for service
<s> mine i had snatched from my knees and held over my head by a sort of instinct
<s> as for the captain he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer and like a wise man lock uppermost
<s> the other three had gone down with the boat
<s> to add to our concern we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half crippled state but the fear before us whether if hunter and joyce were attacked by half a dozen they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm
<s> hunter was steady that we knew joyce was a doubtful case a pleasant polite man for a valet and to brush one s clothes but not entirely fitted for a man of war
<s> with all this in our minds we waded ashore as fast as we could leaving behind us the poor jolly boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions
<s> 18
<s> 0175m
<s> narrative continued by the doctor end of the first day s fighting
<s> 9175m
<s> e made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer
<s> soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket
<s> i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming
<s> captain said i trelawney is the dead shot
<s> give him your gun his own is useless
<s> they exchanged guns and trelawney silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service
<s> at the same time observing gray to be unarmed i handed him my cutlass
<s> it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand knit his brows and make the blade sing through the air
<s> it was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt
<s> forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us
<s> we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineers job anderson the boatswain at their head appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner
<s> they paused as if taken aback and before they recovered not only the squire and i but hunter and joyce from the block house had time to fire
<s> the four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business one of the enemy actually fell and the rest without hesitation turned and plunged into the trees
<s> after reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy
<s> he was stone dead shot through the heart
<s> we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground
<s> both the squire and i returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder
<s> then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor tom
<s> the captain and gray were already examining him and i saw with half an eye that all was over
<s> i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the log house
<s> poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the log house to die
<s> he had lain like a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die
<s> the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child
<s> be i going doctor he asked
<s> tom my man said i you re going home
<s> i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied
<s> tom said the squire say you forgive me won t you
<s> would that be respectful like from me to you squire was the answer
<s> howsoever so be it amen
<s> after a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer
<s> it s the custom sir he added apologetically
<s> and not long after without another word he passed away
<s> in the meantime the captain whom i had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various stores the british colours a bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the log book and pounds of tobacco
<s> he had found a longish fir tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure and with the help of hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log house where the trunks crossed and made an angle
<s> then climbing on the roof he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours
<s> this seemed mightily to relieve him
<s> he re entered the log house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed
<s> but he had an eye on tom s passage for all that and as soon as all was over came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body
<s> don t you take on sir he said shaking the squire s hand
<s> all s well with him no fear for a hand that s been shot down in his duty to captain and owner
<s> it mayn t be good divinity but it s a fact
<s> then he pulled me aside
<s> dr
<s> livesey he said in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort
<s> i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months that if we were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us but neither sooner nor later
<s> you can calculate for yourself i said
<s> why yes returned the captain scratching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of providence i should say we were pretty close hauled
<s> how do you mean i asked
<s> it s a pity sir we lost that second load
<s> that s what i mean replied the captain
<s> as for powder and shot we ll do
<s> but the rations are short very short so short dr
<s> livesey that we re perhaps as well without that extra mouth
<s> and he pointed to the dead body under the flag
<s> just then with a roar and a whistle a round shot passed high above the roof of the log house and plumped far beyond us in the wood
<s> oho said the captain
<s> blaze away you ve little enough powder already my lads
<s> at the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage
<s> captain said the squire the house is quite invisible from the ship
<s> it must be the flag they are aiming at
<s> would it not be wiser to take it in
<s> strike my colours cried the captain
<s> no sir not i and as soon as he had said the words i think we all agreed with him
<s> for it was not only a piece of stout seamanly good feeling it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade
<s> all through the evening they kept thundering away
<s> ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand
<s> we had no ricochet to fear and though one popped in through the roof of the log house and out again through the floor we soon got used to that sort of horse play and minded it no more than cricket
<s> there is one good thing about all this observed the captain the wood in front of us is likely clear
<s> the ebb has made a good while our stores should be uncovered
<s> volunteers to go and bring in pork
<s> gray and hunter were the first to come forward
<s> well armed they stole out of the stockade but it proved a useless mission
<s> the mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israel s gunnery
<s> for four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current
<s> silver was in the stern sheets in command and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own
<s> the captain sat down to his log and here is the beginning of the entry
<s> alexander smollett master david livesey ship s doctor abraham gray carpenter s mate john trelawney owner john hunter and richard joyce owner s servants landsmen being all that is left faithful of the ship s company with stores for ten days at short rations came ashore this day and flew british colours on the log house in treasure island
<s> thomas redruth owner s servant landsman shot by the mutineers james hawkins cabin boy
<s> and at the same time i was wondering over poor jim hawkins fate
<s> a hail on the land side
<s> somebody hailing us said hunter who was on guard
<s> doctor squire captain hullo hunter is that you came the cries
<s> and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins safe and sound come climbing over the stockade
<s> 0179m
<s> 19
<s> 0182m
<s> narrative resumed by jim hawkins the garrison in the stockade
<s> 9182m
<s> s soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt stopped me by the arm and sat down
<s> now said he there s your friends sure enough
<s> far more likely it s the mutineers i answered
<s> that he cried
<s> why in a place like this where nobody puts in but gen lemen of fortune silver would fly the jolly roger you don t make no doubt of that
<s> no that s your friends
<s> there s been blows too and i reckon your friends has had the best of it and here they are ashore in the old stockade as was made years and years ago by flint
<s> ah he was the man to have a headpiece was flint barring rum his match were never seen
<s> he were afraid of none not he on y silver silver was that genteel
<s> well said i that may be so and so be it all the more reason that i should hurry on and join my friends
<s> nay mate returned ben not you
<s> you re a good boy or i m mistook but you re on y a boy all told
<s> now ben gunn is fly
<s> rum wouldn t bring me there where you re going not rum wouldn t till i see your born gen leman and gets it on his word of honour
<s> and you won t forget my words a precious sight that s what you ll say a precious sight more confidence and then nips him
<s> and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness
<s> and when ben gunn is wanted you know where to find him jim
<s> just wheer you found him today
<s> and him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand and he s to come alone
<s> oh and you ll say this ben gunn says you has reasons of his own
<s> well said i i believe i understand
<s> you have something to propose and you wish to see the squire or the doctor and you re to be found where i found you
<s> is that all
<s> and when says you he added
<s> why from about noon observation to about six bells
<s> good said i and now may i go
<s> you won t forget he inquired anxiously
<s> precious sight and reasons of his own says you
<s> reasons of his own that s the mainstay as between man and man
<s> well then still holding me i reckon you can go jim
<s> and jim if you was to see silver you wouldn t go for to sell ben gunn wild horses wouldn t draw it from you no says you
<s> and if them pirates camp ashore jim what would you say but there d be widders in the morning
<s> here he was interrupted by a loud report and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking
<s> the next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction
<s> for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island and balls kept crashing through the woods
<s> i moved from hiding place to hiding place always pursued or so it seemed to me by these terrifying missiles
<s> but towards the end of the bombardment though still i durst not venture in the direction of the stockade where the balls fell oftenest i had begun in a manner to pluck up my heart again and after a long detour to the east crept down among the shore side trees
<s> the sun had just set the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage the tide too was far out and great tracts of sand lay uncovered the air after the heat of the day chilled me through my jacket
<s> the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there was the jolly roger the black flag of piracy flying from her peak
<s> even as i looked there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering and one more round shot whistled through the air
<s> it was the last of the cannonade
<s> i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack
<s> men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade the poor jolly boat i afterwards discovered
<s> away near the mouth of the river a great fire was glowing among the trees and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going the men whom i had seen so gloomy shouting at the oars like children
<s> but there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum
<s> at length i thought i might return towards the stockade
<s> i was pretty far down on the low sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east and is joined at half water to skeleton island and now as i rose to my feet i saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour
<s> it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i should know where to look for one
<s> then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear or shoreward side of the stockade and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party
<s> i had soon told my story and began to look about me
<s> the log house was made of unsquared trunks of pine roof walls and floor
<s> the latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand
<s> there was a porch at the door and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind no other than a great ship s kettle of iron with the bottom knocked out and sunk to her bearings as the captain said among the sand
<s> little had been left besides the framework of the house but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire
<s> the slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed
<s> most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand
<s> very close around the stockade too close for defence they said the wood still flourished high and dense all of fir on the land side but towards the sea with a large admixture of live oaks
<s> the cold evening breeze of which i have spoken whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand
<s> there was sand in our eyes sand in our teeth sand in our suppers sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle for all the world like porridge beginning to boil
<s> our chimney was a square hole in the roof it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye
<s> add to this that gray the new man had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old tom redruth still unburied lay along the wall stiff and stark under the union jack
<s> if we had been allowed to sit idle we should all have fallen in the blues but captain smollett was never the man for that
<s> all hands were called up before him and he divided us into watches
<s> the doctor and gray and i for one the squire hunter and joyce upon the other
<s> tired though we all were two were sent out for firewood two more were set to dig a grave for redruth the doctor was named cook i was put sentry at the door and the captain himself went from one to another keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted
<s> from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes which were almost smoked out of his head and whenever he did so he had a word for me
<s> that man smollett he said once is a better man than i am
<s> and when i say that it means a deal jim
<s> another time he came and was silent for a while
<s> then he put his head on one side and looked at me
<s> is this ben gunn a man he asked
<s> i do not know sir said i
<s> i am not very sure whether he s sane
<s> if there s any doubt about the matter he is returned the doctor
<s> a man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island jim can t expect to appear as sane as you or me
<s> it doesn t lie in human nature
<s> was it cheese you said he had a fancy for
<s> yes sir cheese i answered
<s> well jim says he just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food
<s> you ve seen my snuff box haven t you and you never saw me take snuff the reason being that in my snuff box i carry a piece of parmesan cheese a cheese made in italy very nutritious
<s> well that s for ben gunn
<s> before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare headed in the breeze
<s> a good deal of firewood had been got in but not enough for the captain s fancy and he shook his head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier
<s> then when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects
<s> 0187m
<s> it appears they were at their wits end what to do the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came
<s> but our best hope it was decided was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the hispaniola
<s> from nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen two others were wounded and one at least the man shot beside the gun severely wounded if he were not dead
<s> every time we had a crack at them we were to take it saving our own lives with the extremest care
<s> and besides that we had two able allies rum and the climate
<s> as for the first though we were about half a mile away we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night and as for the second the doctor staked his wig that camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies the half of them would be on their backs before a week
<s> so he added if we are not all shot down first they ll be glad to be packing in the schooner
<s> it s always a ship and they can get to buccaneering again i suppose
<s> first ship that ever i lost said captain smollett
<s> i was dead tired as you may fancy and when i got to sleep which was not till after a great deal of tossing i slept like a log of wood
<s> the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices
<s> flag of truce i heard someone say and then immediately after with a cry of surprise silver himself
<s> and at that up i jumped and rubbing my eyes ran to a loophole in the wall
<s> 20
<s> 0190m
<s> silver s embassy
<s> 9190m
<s> ure enough there were two men just outside the stockade one of them waving a white cloth the other no less a person than silver himself standing placidly by
<s> it was still quite early and the coldest morning that i think i ever was abroad in a chill that pierced into the marrow
<s> the sky was bright and cloudless overhead and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun
<s> but where silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow and they waded knee deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass
<s> the chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island
<s> it was plainly a damp feverish unhealthy spot
<s> keep indoors men said the captain
<s> ten to one this is a trick
<s> then he hailed the buccaneer
<s> who goes stand or we fire
<s> flag of truce cried silver
<s> the captain was in the porch keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot should any be intended
<s> he turned and spoke to us doctor s watch on the lookout
<s> dr
<s> livesey take the north side if you please jim the east gray west
<s> the watch below all hands to load muskets
<s> lively men and careful
<s> and then he turned again to the mutineers
<s> and what do you want with your flag of truce he cried
<s> this time it was the other man who replied
<s> cap n silver sir to come on board and make terms he shouted
<s> cap n silver don t know him
<s> who s he cried the captain
<s> and we could hear him adding to himself cap n is it my heart and here s promotion
<s> long john answered for himself
<s> me sir
<s> these poor lads have chosen me cap n after your desertion sir laying a particular emphasis upon the word desertion
<s> we re willing to submit if we can come to terms and no bones about it
<s> all i ask is your word cap n smollett to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade and one minute to get out o shot before a gun is fired
<s> my man said captain smollett i have not the slightest desire to talk to you
<s> if you wish to talk to me you can come that s all
<s> if there s any treachery it ll be on your side and the lord help you
<s> that s enough cap n shouted long john cheerily
<s> a word from you s enough
<s> i know a gentleman and you may lay to that
<s> we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold silver back
<s> nor was that wonderful seeing how cavalier had been the captain s answer
<s> but silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd
<s> then he advanced to the stockade threw over his crutch got a leg up and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side
<s> i will confess that i was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry indeed i had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain who had now seated himself on the threshold with his elbows on his knees his head in his hands and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand
<s> he was whistling come lasses and lads
<s> silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll
<s> what with the steepness of the incline the thick tree stumps and the soft sand he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays
<s> but he stuck to it like a man in silence and at last arrived before the captain whom he saluted in the handsomest style
<s> he was tricked out in his best an immense blue coat thick with brass buttons hung as low as to his knees and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head
<s> here you are my man said the captain raising his head
<s> you had better sit down
<s> you ain t a going to let me inside cap n complained long john
<s> it s a main cold morning to be sure sir to sit outside upon the sand
<s> why silver said the captain if you had pleased to be an honest man you might have been sitting in your galley
<s> it s your own doing
<s> you re either my ship s cook and then you were treated handsome or cap n silver a common mutineer and pirate and then you can go hang
<s> well well cap n returned the sea cook sitting down as he was bidden on the sand you ll have to give me a hand up again that s all
<s> a sweet pretty place you have of it here
<s> ah there s jim the top of the morning to you jim
<s> doctor here s my service
<s> why there you all are together like a happy family in a manner of speaking
<s> 0190m
<s> if you have anything to say my man better say it said the captain
<s> right you were cap n smollett replied silver
<s> dooty is dooty to be sure
<s> well now you look here that was a good lay of yours last night
<s> i don t deny it was a good lay
<s> some of you pretty handy with a handspike end
<s> and i ll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook maybe all was shook maybe i was shook myself maybe that s why i m here for terms
<s> but you mark me cap n it won t do twice by thunder we ll have to do sentry go and ease off a point or so on the rum
<s> maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind s eye
<s> but i ll tell you i was sober i was on y dog tired and if i d awoke a second sooner i d a caught you at the act i would
<s> he wasn t dead when i got round to him not he
<s> well says captain smollett as cool as can be
<s> all that silver said was a riddle to him but you would never have guessed it from his tone
<s> as for me i began to have an inkling
<s> ben gunn s last words came back to my mind
<s> i began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with
<s> well here it is said silver
<s> we want that treasure and we ll have it that s our point you would just as soon save your lives i reckon and that s yours
<s> you have a chart haven t you
<s> that s as may be replied the captain
<s> oh well you have i know that returned long john
<s> you needn t be so husky with a man there ain t a particle of service in that and you may lay to it
<s> what i mean is we want your chart
<s> now i never meant you no harm myself
<s> that won t do with me my man interrupted the captain
<s> we know exactly what you meant to do and we don t care for now you see you can t do it
<s> and the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe
<s> if abe gray silver broke out
<s> avast there cried mr
<s> smollett
<s> gray told me nothing and i asked him nothing and what s more i would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first
<s> so there s my mind for you my man on that
<s> this little whiff of temper seemed to cool silver down
<s> he had been growing nettled before but now he pulled himself together
<s> like enough said he
<s> i would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape or might not as the case were
<s> and seein as how you are about to take a pipe cap n i ll make so free as do likewise
<s> and he filled a pipe and lighted it and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while now looking each other in the face now stopping their tobacco now leaning forward to spit
<s> it was as good as the play to see them
<s> now resumed silver here it is
<s> you give us the chart to get the treasure by and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep
<s> you do that and we ll offer you a choice
<s> either you come aboard along of us once the treasure shipped and then i ll give you my affy davy upon my word of honour to clap you somewhere safe ashore
<s> or if that ain t to your fancy some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing then you can stay here you can
<s> we ll divide stores with you man for man and i ll give my affy davy as before to speak the first ship i sight and send em here to pick you up
<s> now you ll own that s talking
<s> handsomer you couldn t look to get now you
<s> and i hope raising his voice that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words for what is spoke to one is spoke to all
<s> captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand
<s> is that all he asked
<s> every last word by thunder answered john
<s> refuse that and you ve seen the last of me but musket balls
<s> very good said the captain
<s> now you ll hear me
<s> if you ll come up one by one unarmed i ll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in england
<s> if you won t my name is alexander smollett i ve flown my sovereign s colours and i ll see you all to davy jones
<s> you can t find the treasure
<s> you can t sail the ship there s not a man among you fit to sail the ship
<s> you can t fight us gray there got away from five of you
<s> your ship s in irons master silver you re on a lee shore and so you ll find
<s> i stand here and tell you so and they re the last good words you ll get from me for in the name of heaven i ll put a bullet in your back when next i meet you
<s> tramp my lad
<s> bundle out of this please hand over hand and double quick
<s> silver s face was a picture his eyes started in his head with wrath
<s> he shook the fire out of his pipe
<s> give me a hand up he cried
<s> not i returned the captain
<s> who ll give me a hand up he roared
<s> not a man among us moved
<s> growling the foulest imprecations he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch
<s> then he spat into the spring
<s> there he cried
<s> that s what i think of ye
<s> before an hour s out i ll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon
<s> laugh by thunder laugh before an hour s out ye ll laugh upon the other side
<s> them that die ll be the lucky ones
<s> and with a dreadful oath he stumbled off ploughed down the sand was helped across the stockade after four or five failures by the man with the flag of truce and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees
<s> 21
<s> 0198m
<s> the attack
<s> 9198m
<s> s soon as silver disappeared the captain who had been closely watching him turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but gray
<s> it was the first time we had ever seen him angry
<s> quarters he roared
<s> and then as we all slunk back to our places gray he said i ll put your name in the log you ve stood by your duty like a seaman
<s> mr
<s> trelawney i m surprised at you sir
<s> doctor i thought you had worn the king s coat if that was how you served at fontenoy sir you d have been better in your berth
<s> the doctor s watch were all back at their loopholes the rest were busy loading the spare muskets and everyone with a red face you may be certain and a flea in his ear as the saying is
<s> the captain looked on for a while in silence
<s> then he spoke
<s> my lads said he i ve given silver a broadside
<s> i pitched it in red hot on purpose and before the hour s out as he said we shall be boarded
<s> we re outnumbered i needn t tell you that but we fight in shelter and a minute ago i should have said we fought with discipline
<s> i ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them if you choose
<s> then he went the rounds and saw as he said that all was clear
<s> on the two short sides of the house east and west there were only two loopholes on the south side where the porch was two again and on the north side five
<s> there was a round score of muskets for the seven of us the firewood had been built into four piles tables you might say one about the middle of each side and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders
<s> in the middle the cutlasses lay ranged
<s> toss out the fire said the captain the chill is past and we mustn t have smoke in our eyes
<s> the iron fire basket was carried bodily out by mr
<s> trelawney and the embers smothered among sand
<s> hawkins hasn t had his breakfast
<s> hawkins help yourself and back to your post to eat it continued captain smollett
<s> lively now my lad you ll want it before you ve done
<s> hunter serve out a round of brandy to all hands
<s> and while this was going on the captain completed in his own mind the plan of the defence
<s> doctor you will take the door he resumed
<s> see and don t expose yourself keep within and fire through the porch
<s> hunter take the east side there
<s> joyce you stand by the west my man
<s> mr
<s> trelawney you are the best shot you and gray will take this long north side with the five loopholes it s there the danger is
<s> if they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports things would begin to look dirty
<s> hawkins neither you nor i are much account at the shooting we ll stand by to load and bear a hand
<s> as the captain had said the chill was past
<s> as soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught
<s> soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house
<s> jackets and coats were flung aside shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders and we stood there each at his post in a fever of heat and anxiety
<s> an hour passed away
<s> hang them said the captain
<s> this is as dull as the doldrums
<s> gray whistle for a wind
<s> and just at that moment came the first news of the attack
<s> if you please sir said joyce if i see anyone am i to fire
<s> i told you so cried the captain
<s> thank you sir returned joyce with the same quiet civility
<s> nothing followed for a time but the remark had set us all on the alert straining ears and eyes the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face
<s> so some seconds passed till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket and fired
<s> the report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley shot behind shot like a string of geese from every side of the enclosure
<s> several bullets struck the log house but not one entered and as the smoke cleared away and vanished the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before
<s> not a bough waved not the gleam of a musket barrel betrayed the presence of our foes
<s> did you hit your man asked the captain
<s> no sir replied joyce
<s> i believe not sir
<s> next best thing to tell the truth muttered captain smollett
<s> load his gun hawkins
<s> how many should say there were on your side doctor
<s> i know precisely said dr
<s> livesey
<s> three shots were fired on this side
<s> i saw the three flashes two close together one farther to the west
<s> three repeated the captain
<s> and how many on yours mr
<s> trelawney
<s> but this was not so easily answered
<s> there had come many from the north seven by the squire s computation eight or nine according to gray
<s> from the east and west only a single shot had been fired
<s> it was plain therefore that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities
<s> but captain smollett made no change in his arrangements
<s> if the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade he argued they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold
<s> nor had we much time left to us for thought
<s> suddenly with a loud huzza a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade
<s> at the same moment the fire was once more opened from the woods and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor s musket into bits
<s> the boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys
<s> squire and gray fired again and yet again three men fell one forwards into the enclosure two back on the outside
<s> but of these one was evidently more frightened than hurt for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees
<s> 0201m
<s> two had bit the dust one had fled four had made good their footing inside our defences while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men each evidently supplied with several muskets kept up a hot though useless fire on the log house
<s> the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building shouting as they ran and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them
<s> several shots were fired but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect
<s> in a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us
<s> the head of job anderson the boatswain appeared at the middle loophole
<s> at em all hands all hands he roared in a voice of thunder
<s> at the same moment another pirate grasped hunter s musket by the muzzle wrenched it from his hands plucked it through the loophole and with one stunning blow laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor
<s> meanwhile a third running unharmed all around the house appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor
<s> our position was utterly reversed
<s> a moment since we were firing under cover at an exposed enemy now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow
<s> the log house was full of smoke to which we owed our comparative safety
<s> cries and confusion the flashes and reports of pistol shots and one loud groan rang in my ears
<s> out lads out and fight em in the open cutlasses cried the captain
<s> i snatched a cutlass from the pile and someone at the same time snatching another gave me a cut across the knuckles which i hardly felt
<s> i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight
<s> someone was close behind i knew not whom
<s> right in front the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill and just as my eyes fell upon him beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face
<s> round the house lads round the house cried the captain and even in the hurly burly i perceived a change in his voice
<s> mechanically i obeyed turned eastwards and with my cutlass raised ran round the corner of the house
<s> next moment i was face to face with anderson
<s> he roared aloud and his hanger went up above his head flashing in the sunlight
<s> i had not time to be afraid but as the blow still hung impending leaped in a trice upon one side and missing my foot in the soft sand rolled headlong down the slope
<s> when i had first sallied from the door the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us
<s> one man in a red night cap with his cutlass in his mouth had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across
<s> well so short had been the interval that when i found my feet again all was in the same posture the fellow with the red night cap still half way over another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade
<s> and yet in this breath of time the fight was over and the victory was ours
<s> gray following close behind me had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow
<s> another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony the pistol still smoking in his hand
<s> a third as i had seen the doctor had disposed of at a blow
<s> of the four who had scaled the palisade one only remained unaccounted for and he having left his cutlass on the field was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him
<s> fire fire from the house cried the doctor
<s> and you lads back into cover
<s> but his words were unheeded no shot was fired and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood
<s> in three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade
<s> the doctor and gray and i ran full speed for shelter
<s> the survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets and at any moment the fire might recommence
<s> the house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory
<s> hunter lay beside his loophole stunned joyce by his shot through the head never to move again while right in the centre the squire was supporting the captain one as pale as the other
<s> the captain s wounded said mr
<s> trelawney
<s> have they run asked mr
<s> smollett
<s> all that could you may be bound returned the doctor but there s five of them will never run again
<s> five cried the captain
<s> come that s better
<s> five against three leaves us four to nine
<s> that s better odds than we had at starting
<s> we were seven to nineteen then or thought we were and that s as bad to bear
<s> the mutineers were soon only eight in number for the man shot by mr
<s> trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound
<s> but this was of course not known till after by the faithful party
<s> 0207m
<s> part five my sea adventure
<s> 22
<s> 0209m
<s> how my sea adventure began
<s> 9209m
<s> here was no return of the mutineers not so much as another shot out of the woods
<s> they had got their rations for that day as the captain put it and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner
<s> squire and i cooked outside in spite of the danger and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor s patients
<s> out of the eight men who had fallen in the action only three still breathed that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole hunter and captain smollett and of these the first two were as good as dead the mutineer indeed died under the doctor s knife and hunter do what we could never recovered consciousness in this world
<s> he lingered all day breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling and some time in the following night without sign or sound he went to his maker
<s> as for the captain his wounds were grievous indeed but not dangerous
<s> no organ was fatally injured
<s> anderson s ball for it was job that shot him first had broken his shoulder blade and touched the lung not badly the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf
<s> he was sure to recover the doctor said but in the meantime and for weeks to come he must not walk nor move his arm nor so much as speak when he could help it
<s> my own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea bite
<s> doctor livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain
<s> after dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain s side awhile in consultation and when they had talked to their hearts content it being then a little past noon the doctor took up his hat and pistols girt on a cutlass put the chart in his pocket and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees
<s> gray and i were sitting together at the far end of the block house to be out of earshot of our officers consulting and gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again so thunder struck he was at this occurrence
<s> why in the name of davy jones said he is dr
<s> livesey mad
<s> why no says i
<s> he s about the last of this crew for that i take it
<s> well shipmate said gray mad he may not be but if he s not you mark my words i am
<s> i take it replied i the doctor has his idea and if i am right he s going now to see ben gunn
<s> i was right as appeared later but in the meantime the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun i began to get another thought into my head which was not by any means so right
<s> what i began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines while i sat grilling with my clothes stuck to the hot resin and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that i took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear
<s> all the time i was washing out the block house and then washing up the things from dinner this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger till at last being near a bread bag and no one then observing me i took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit
<s> i was a fool if you like and certainly i was going to do a foolish over bold act but i was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power
<s> these biscuits should anything befall me would keep me at least from starving till far on in the next day
<s> the next thing i laid hold of was a brace of pistols and as i already had a powder horn and bullets i felt myself well supplied with arms
<s> as for the scheme i had in my head it was not a bad one in itself
<s> i was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea find the white rock i had observed last evening and ascertain whether it was there or not that ben gunn had hidden his boat a thing quite worth doing as i still believe
<s> but as i was certain i should not be allowed to leave the enclosure my only plan was to take french leave and slip out when nobody was watching and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong
<s> but i was only a boy and i had made my mind up
<s> well as things at last fell out i found an admirable opportunity
<s> the squire and gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages the coast was clear i made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees and before my absence was observed i was out of cry of my companions
<s> this was my second folly far worse than the first as i left but two sound men to guard the house but like the first it was a help towards saving all of us
<s> i took my way straight for the east coast of the island for i was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage
<s> it was already late in the afternoon although still warm and sunny
<s> as i continued to thread the tall woods i could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual
<s> soon cool draughts of air began to reach me and a few steps farther i came forth into the open borders of the grove and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach
<s> i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island
<s> the sun might blaze overhead the air be without a breath the surface smooth and blue but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast thundering and thundering by day and night and i scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise
<s> i walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment till thinking i was now got far enough to the south i took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit
<s> behind me was the sea in front the anchorage
<s> the sea breeze as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence was already at an end it had been succeeded by light variable airs from the south and south east carrying great banks of fog and the anchorage under lee of skeleton island lay still and leaden as when first we entered it
<s> the hispaniola in that unbroken mirror was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline the jolly roger hanging from her peak
<s> alongside lay one of the gigs silver in the stern sheets him i could always recognize while a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks one of them with a red cap the very rogue that i had seen some hours before stride legs upon the palisade
<s> apparently they were talking and laughing though at that distance upwards of a mile i could of course hear no word of what was said
<s> all at once there began the most horrid unearthly screaming which at first startled me badly though i had soon remembered the voice of captain flint and even thought i could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her master s wrist
<s> soon after the jolly boat shoved off and pulled for shore and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion
<s> just about the same time the sun had gone down behind the spy glass and as the fog was collecting rapidly it began to grow dark in earnest
<s> i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that evening
<s> the white rock visible enough above the brush was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit and it took me a goodish while to get up with it crawling often on all fours among the scrub
<s> night had almost come when i laid my hand on its rough sides
<s> right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee deep that grew there very plentifully and in the centre of the dell sure enough a little tent of goat skins like what the gipsies carry about with them in england
<s> i dropped into the hollow lifted the side of the tent and there was ben gunn s boat home made if ever anything was home made a rude lop sided framework of tough wood and stretched upon that a covering of goat skin with the hair inside
<s> the thing was extremely small even for me and i can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full sized man
<s> there was one thwart set as low as possible a kind of stretcher in the bows and a double paddle for propulsion
<s> 0213m
<s> i had not then seen a coracle such as the ancient britons made but i have seen one since and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunn s boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man
<s> but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed for it was exceedingly light and portable
<s> well now that i had found the boat you would have thought i had had enough of truantry for once but in the meantime i had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried it out i believe in the teeth of captain smollett himself
<s> this was to slip out under cover of the night cut the hispaniola adrift and let her go ashore where she fancied
<s> i had quite made up my mind that the mutineers after their repulse of the morning had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea this i thought it would be a fine thing to prevent and now that i had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat i thought it might be done with little risk
<s> down i sat to wait for darkness and made a hearty meal of biscuit
<s> it was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose
<s> the fog had now buried all heaven
<s> as the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared absolute blackness settled down on treasure island
<s> and when at last i shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where i had supped there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage
<s> one was the great fire on shore by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp
<s> the other a mere blur of light upon the darkness indicated the position of the anchored ship
<s> she had swung round to the ebb her bow was now towards me the only lights on board were in the cabin and what i saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window
<s> the ebb had already run some time and i had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand where i sank several times above the ankle before i came to the edge of the retreating water and wading a little way in with some strength and dexterity set my coracle keel downwards on the surface
<s> 23
<s> 0217m
<s> the ebb tide runs
<s> 9217m
<s> he coracle as i had ample reason to know before i was done with her was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seaway but she was the most cross grained lop sided craft to manage
<s> do as you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at
<s> even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way
<s> certainly i did not know her way
<s> she turned in every direction but the one i was bound to go the most part of the time we were broadside on and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the tide
<s> by good fortune paddle as i pleased the tide was still sweeping me down and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway hardly to be missed
<s> first she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness then her spars and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seemed for the farther i went the brisker grew the current of the ebb i was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold
<s> the hawser was as taut as a bowstring and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor
<s> all round the hull in the blackness the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream
<s> one cut with my sea gully and the hispaniola would go humming down the tide
<s> so far so good but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser suddenly cut is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse
<s> ten to one if i were so foolhardy as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor i and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water
<s> this brought me to a full stop and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me i should have had to abandon my design
<s> but the light airs which had begun blowing from the south east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south west
<s> just while i was meditating a puff came caught the hispaniola and forced her up into the current and to my great joy i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water
<s> with that i made my mind up took out my gully opened it with my teeth and cut one strand after another till the vessel swung only by two
<s> then i lay quiet waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind
<s> all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin but to say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that i had scarcely given ear
<s> now however when i had nothing else to do i began to pay more heed
<s> one i recognized for the coxswain s israel hands that had been flint s gunner in former days
<s> the other was of course my friend of the red night cap
<s> both men were plainly the worse of drink and they were still drinking for even while i was listening one of them with a drunken cry opened the stern window and threw out something which i divined to be an empty bottle
<s> but they were not only tipsy it was plain that they were furiously angry
<s> oaths flew like hailstones and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as i thought was sure to end in blows
<s> but each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result
<s> on shore i could see the glow of the great camp fire burning warmly through the shore side trees
<s> someone was singing a dull old droning sailor s song with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer
<s> i had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words
<s> but one man of her crew alive
<s> what put to sea with seventy five
<s> and i thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning
<s> but indeed from what i saw all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on
<s> at last the breeze came the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark i felt the hawser slacken once more and with a good tough effort cut the last fibres through
<s> the breeze had but little action on the coracle and i was almost instantly swept against the bows of the hispaniola
<s> at the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heel spinning slowly end for end across the current
<s> i wrought like a fiend for i expected every moment to be swamped and since i found i could not push the coracle directly off i now shoved straight astern
<s> at length i was clear of my dangerous neighbour and just as i gave the last impulsion my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks
<s> instantly i grasped it
<s> why i should have done so i can hardly say
<s> it was at first mere instinct but once i had it in my hands and found it fast curiosity began to get the upper hand and i determined i should have one look through the cabin window
<s> i pulled in hand over hand on the cord and when i judged myself near enough rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin
<s> by this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water indeed we had already fetched up level with the camp fire
<s> the ship was talking as sailors say loudly treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash and until i got my eye above the window sill i could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm
<s> one glance however was sufficient and it was only one glance that i durst take from that unsteady skiff
<s> it showed me hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle each with a hand upon the other s throat
<s> 0223m
<s> i dropped upon the thwart again none too soon for i was near overboard
<s> i could see nothing for the moment but these two furious encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp and i shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness
<s> the endless ballad had come to an end at last and the whole diminished company about the camp fire had broken into the chorus i had heard so often
<s> fifteen men on the dead man s chest
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> drink and the devil had done for the rest
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> i was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the hispaniola when i was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle
<s> at the same moment she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course
<s> the speed in the meantime had strangely increased
<s> i opened my eyes at once
<s> all round me were little ripples combing over with a sharp bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent
<s> the hispaniola herself a few yards in whose wake i was still being whirled along seemed to stagger in her course and i saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night nay as i looked longer i made sure she also was wheeling to the southward
<s> i glanced over my shoulder and my heart jumped against my ribs
<s> there right behind me was the glow of the camp fire
<s> the current had turned at right angles sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle ever quickening ever bubbling higher ever muttering louder it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea
<s> suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw turning perhaps through twenty degrees and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board i could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and i knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster
<s> i lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its maker
<s> at the end of the straits i made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers where all my troubles would be ended speedily and though i could perhaps bear to die i could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached
<s> so i must have lain for hours continually beaten to and fro upon the billows now and again wetted with flying sprays and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge
<s> gradually weariness grew upon me a numbness an occasional stupor fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors until sleep at last supervened and in my sea tossed coracle i lay and dreamed of home and the old admiral benbow
<s> 24
<s> 0226m
<s> the cruise of the coracle
<s> 9226m
<s> t was broad day when i awoke and found myself tossing at the south west end of treasure island
<s> the sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the spy glass which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs
<s> haulbowline head and mizzen mast hill were at my elbow the hill bare and dark the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock
<s> i was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward and it was my first thought to paddle in and land
<s> that notion was soon given over
<s> among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed loud reverberations heavy sprays flying and falling succeeded one another from second to second and i saw myself if i ventured nearer dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags
<s> nor was that all for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports i beheld huge slimy monsters soft snails as it were of incredible bigness two or three score of them together making the rocks to echo with their barkings
<s> i have understood since that they were sea lions and entirely harmless
<s> but the look of them added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf was more than enough to disgust me of that landing place
<s> i felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils
<s> 0229m
<s> in the meantime i had a better chance as i supposed before me
<s> north of haulbowline head the land runs in a long way leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand
<s> to the north of that again there comes another cape cape of the woods as it was marked upon the chart buried in tall green pines which descended to the margin of the sea
<s> i remembered what silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of treasure island and seeing from my position that i was already under its influence i preferred to leave haulbowline head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier looking cape of the woods
<s> there was a great smooth swell upon the sea
<s> the wind blowing steady and gentle from the south there was no contrariety between that and the current and the billows rose and fell unbroken
<s> had it been otherwise i must long ago have perished but as it was it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride
<s> often as i still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale i would see a big blue summit heaving close above me yet the coracle would but bounce a little dance as if on springs and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird
<s> i began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling
<s> but even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle
<s> and i had hardly moved before the boat giving up at once her gentle dancing movement ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy and struck her nose with a spout of spray deep into the side of the next wave
<s> i was drenched and terrified and fell instantly back into my old position whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows
<s> it was plain she was not to be interfered with and at that rate since i could in no way influence her course what hope had i left of reaching land
<s> i began to be horribly frightened but i kept my head for all that
<s> first moving with all care i gradually baled out the coracle with my sea cap then getting my eye once more above the gunwale i set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers
<s> i found each wave instead of the big smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel s deck was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land full of peaks and smooth places and valleys
<s> the coracle left to herself turning from side to side threaded so to speak her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher toppling summits of the wave
<s> well now thought i to myself it is plain i must lie where i am and not disturb the balance but it is plain also that i can put the paddle over the side and from time to time in smooth places give her a shove or two towards land
<s> no sooner thought upon than done
<s> there i lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore
<s> it was very tiring and slow work yet i did visibly gain ground and as we drew near the cape of the woods though i saw i must infallibly miss that point i had still made some hundred yards of easting
<s> i was indeed close in
<s> i could see the cool green tree tops swaying together in the breeze and i felt sure i should make the next promontory without fail
<s> it was high time for i now began to be tortured with thirst
<s> the glow of the sun from above its thousandfold reflection from the waves the sea water that fell and dried upon me caking my very lips with salt combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache
<s> the sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing but the current had soon carried me past the point and as the next reach of sea opened out i beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts
<s> right in front of me not half a mile away i beheld the hispaniola under sail
<s> i made sure of course that i should be taken but i was so distressed for want of water that i scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought and long before i had come to a conclusion surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and i could do nothing but stare and wonder
<s> the hispaniola was under her main sail and two jibs and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver
<s> when i first sighted her all her sails were drawing she was lying a course about north west and i presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage
<s> presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward so that i thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase
<s> at last however she fell right into the wind s eye was taken dead aback and stood there awhile helpless with her sails shivering
<s> clumsy fellows said i they must still be drunk as owls
<s> and i thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping
<s> meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack sailed swiftly for a minute or so and brought up once more dead in the wind s eye
<s> again and again was this repeated
<s> to and fro up and down north south east and west the hispaniola sailed by swoops and dashes and at each repetition ended as she had begun with idly flapping canvas
<s> it became plain to me that nobody was steering
<s> and if so where were the men either they were dead drunk or had deserted her i thought and perhaps if i could get on board i might return the vessel to her captain
<s> the current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate
<s> as for the latter s sailing it was so wild and intermittent and she hung each time so long in irons that she certainly gained nothing if she did not even lose
<s> if only i dared to sit up and paddle i made sure that i could overhaul her
<s> the scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage
<s> up i got was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself with all my strength and caution to paddle after the unsteered hispaniola
<s> once i shipped a sea so heavy that i had to stop and bail with my heart fluttering like a bird but gradually i got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face
<s> i was now gaining rapidly on the schooner i could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about and still no soul appeared upon her decks
<s> i could not choose but suppose she was deserted
<s> if not the men were lying drunk below where i might batten them down perhaps and do what i chose with the ship
<s> for some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me standing still
<s> she headed nearly due south yawing of course all the time
<s> each time she fell off her sails partly filled and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again
<s> i have said this was the worst thing possible for me for helpless as she looked in this situation with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck she still continued to run away from me not only with the speed of the current but by the whole amount of her leeway which was naturally great
<s> but now at last i had my chance
<s> the breeze fell for some seconds very low and the current gradually turning her the hispaniola revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day
<s> the main sail hung drooped like a banner
<s> she was stock still but for the current
<s> for the last little while i had even lost but now redoubling my efforts i began once more to overhaul the chase
<s> i was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap she filled on the port tack and was off again stooping and skimming like a swallow
<s> my first impulse was one of despair but my second was towards joy
<s> round she came till she was broadside on to me round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us
<s> i could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot
<s> immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle
<s> and then of a sudden i began to comprehend
<s> i had scarce time to think scarce time to act and save myself
<s> i was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next
<s> the bowsprit was over my head
<s> i sprang to my feet and leaped stamping the coracle under water
<s> with one hand i caught the jib boom while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace and as i still clung there panting a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that i was left without retreat on the hispaniola
<s> 25
<s> 0234m
<s> i strike the jolly roger
<s> 9234m
<s> had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack with a report like a gun
<s> the schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse but next moment the other sails still drawing the jib flapped back again and hung idle
<s> this had nearly tossed me off into the sea and now i lost no time crawled back along the bowsprit and tumbled head foremost on the deck
<s> i was on the lee side of the forecastle and the mainsail which was still drawing concealed from me a certain portion of the after deck
<s> not a soul was to be seen
<s> the planks which had not been swabbed since the mutiny bore the print of many feet and an empty bottle broken by the neck tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers
<s> suddenly the hispaniola came right into the wind
<s> the jibs behind me cracked aloud the rudder slammed to the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder and at the same moment the main boom swung inboard the sheet groaning in the blocks and showed me the lee after deck
<s> there were the two watchmen sure enough red cap on his back as stiff as a handspike with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips israel hands propped against the bulwarks his chin on his chest his hands lying open before him on the deck his face as white under its tan as a tallow candle
<s> for a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse the sails filling now on one tack now on another and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain
<s> now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship s bows against the swell so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home made lop sided coracle now gone to the bottom of the sea
<s> at every jump of the schooner red cap slipped to and fro but what was ghastly to behold neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage
<s> at every jump too hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck his feet sliding ever the farther out and the whole body canting towards the stern so that his face became little by little hid from me and at last i could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker
<s> at the same time i observed around both of them splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath
<s> while i was thus looking and wondering in a calm moment when the ship was still israel hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which i had seen him first
<s> the moan which told of pain and deadly weakness and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart
<s> but when i remembered the talk i had overheard from the apple barrel all pity left me
<s> i walked aft until i reached the main mast
<s> come aboard mr
<s> hands i said ironically
<s> he rolled his eyes round heavily but he was too far gone to express surprise
<s> all he could do was to utter one word brandy
<s> it occurred to me there was no time to lose and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck i slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin
<s> it was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy
<s> all the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart
<s> the floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp
<s> the bulkheads all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt bore a pattern of dirty hands
<s> dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship
<s> one of the doctor s medical books lay open on the table half of the leaves gutted out i suppose for pipelights
<s> in the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow obscure and brown as umber
<s> i went into the cellar all the barrels were gone and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away
<s> certainly since the mutiny began not a man of them could ever have been sober
<s> foraging about i found a bottle with some brandy left for hands and for myself i routed out some biscuit some pickled fruits a great bunch of raisins and a piece of cheese
<s> with these i came on deck put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain s reach went forward to the water breaker and had a good deep drink of water and then and not till then gave hands the brandy
<s> he must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth
<s> aye said he by thunder but i wanted some o that
<s> i had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat
<s> much hurt i asked him
<s> he grunted or rather i might say he barked
<s> if that doctor was aboard he said i d be right enough in a couple of turns but i don t have no manner of luck you see and that s what s the matter with me
<s> as for that swab he s good and dead he is he added indicating the man with the red cap
<s> he warn t no seaman anyhow
<s> and where mought you have come from
<s> well said i i ve come aboard to take possession of this ship mr
<s> hands and you ll please regard me as your captain until further notice
<s> he looked at me sourly enough but said nothing
<s> some of the colour had come back into his cheeks though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about
<s> by the by i continued i can t have these colours mr
<s> hands and by your leave i ll strike em
<s> better none than these
<s> 0237m
<s> and again dodging the boom i ran to the colour lines handed down their cursed black flag and chucked it overboard
<s> god save the king said i waving my cap
<s> and there s an end to captain silver
<s> he watched me keenly and slyly his chin all the while on his breast
<s> i reckon he said at last i reckon cap n hawkins you ll kind of want to get ashore now
<s> s pose we talks
<s> why yes says i with all my heart mr
<s> hands
<s> say on
<s> and i went back to my meal with a good appetite
<s> this man he began nodding feebly at the corpse o brien were his name a rank irelander this man and me got the canvas on her meaning for to sail her back
<s> well he s dead now he is as dead as bilge and who s to sail this ship i don t see
<s> without i gives you a hint you ain t that man as far s i can tell
<s> now look here you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up you do and i ll tell you how to sail her and that s about square all round i take it
<s> i ll tell you one thing says i i m not going back to captain kidd s anchorage
<s> i mean to get into north inlet and beach her quietly there
<s> to be sure you did he cried
<s> why i ain t sich an infernal lubber after all
<s> i can see can t i i ve tried my fling i have and i ve lost and it s you has the wind of me
<s> north inlet why i haven t no ch ice not i i d help you sail her up to execution dock by thunder so i would
<s> well as it seemed to me there was some sense in this
<s> we struck our bargain on the spot
<s> in three minutes i had the hispaniola sailing easily before the wind along the coast of treasure island with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as north inlet before high water when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land
<s> then i lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest where i got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother s
<s> with this and with my aid hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy he began to pick up visibly sat straighter up spoke louder and clearer and looked in every way another man
<s> the breeze served us admirably
<s> we skimmed before it like a bird the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute
<s> soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low sandy country sparsely dotted with dwarf pines and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north
<s> i was greatly elated with my new command and pleased with the bright sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast
<s> i had now plenty of water and good things to eat and my conscience which had smitten me hard for my desertion was quieted by the great conquest i had made
<s> i should i think have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face
<s> it was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness a haggard old man s smile but there was besides that a grain of derision a shadow of treachery in his expression as he craftily watched and watched and watched me at my work
<s> 26
<s> 0241m
<s> israel hands
<s> 9241m
<s> he wind serving us to a desire now hauled into the west
<s> we could run so much the easier from the north east corner of the island to the mouth of the north inlet
<s> only as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther time hung on our hands
<s> the coxswain told me how to lay the ship to after a good many trials i succeeded and we both sat in silence over another meal
<s> cap n said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile here s my old shipmate o brien s pose you was to heave him overboard
<s> i ain t partic lar as a rule and i don t take no blame for settling his hash but i don t reckon him ornamental now do you
<s> i m not strong enough and i don t like the job and there he lies for me said i
<s> this here s an unlucky ship this hispaniola jim he went on blinking
<s> there s a power of men been killed in this hispaniola a sight o poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to bristol
<s> i never seen sich dirty luck not i
<s> there was this here o brien now he s dead ain t he well now i m no scholar and you re a lad as can read and figure and to put it straight do you take it as a dead man is dead for good or do he come alive again
<s> you can kill the body mr
<s> hands but not the spirit you must know that already i replied
<s> o brien there is in another world and may be watching us
<s> ah says he
<s> well that s unfort nate appears as if killing parties was a waste of time
<s> howsomever sperrits don t reckon for much by what i ve seen
<s> i ll chance it with the sperrits jim
<s> and now you ve spoke up free and i ll take it kind if you d step down into that there cabin and get me a well a shiver my timbers i can t hit the name on t well you get me a bottle of wine jim this here brandy s too strong for my head
<s> now the coxswain s hesitation seemed to be unnatural and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy i entirely disbelieved it
<s> the whole story was a pretext
<s> he wanted me to leave the deck so much was plain but with what purpose i could in no way imagine
<s> his eyes never met mine they kept wandering to and fro up and down now with a look to the sky now with a flitting glance upon the dead o brien
<s> all the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty embarrassed manner so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception
<s> i was prompt with my answer however for i saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid i could easily conceal my suspicions to the end
<s> some wine i said
<s> far better
<s> will you have white or red
<s> well i reckon it s about the blessed same to me shipmate he replied so it s strong and plenty of it what s the odds
<s> all right i answered
<s> i ll bring you port mr
<s> hands
<s> but i ll have to dig for it
<s> with that i scuttled down the companion with all the noise i could slipped off my shoes ran quietly along the sparred gallery mounted the forecastle ladder and popped my head out of the fore companion
<s> i knew he would not expect to see me there yet i took every precaution possible and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true
<s> he had risen from his position to his hands and knees and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved for i could hear him stifle a groan yet it was at a good rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck
<s> in half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked out of a coil of rope a long knife or rather a short dirk discoloured to the hilt with blood
<s> he looked upon it for a moment thrusting forth his under jaw tried the point upon his hand and then hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark
<s> this was all that i required to know
<s> israel could move about he was now armed and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me it was plain that i was meant to be the victim
<s> what he would do afterwards whether he would try to crawl right across the island from north inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire long tom trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him was of course more than i could say
<s> yet i felt sure that i could trust him in one point since in that our interests jumped together and that was in the disposition of the schooner
<s> we both desired to have her stranded safe enough in a sheltered place and so that when the time came she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be and until that was done i considered that my life would certainly be spared
<s> while i was thus turning the business over in my mind i had not been idle with my body
<s> i had stolen back to the cabin slipped once more into my shoes and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine and now with this for an excuse i made my reappearance on the deck
<s> hands lay as i had left him all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light
<s> he looked up however at my coming knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often and took a good swig with his favourite toast of here s luck then he lay quiet for a little and then pulling out a stick of tobacco begged me to cut him a quid
<s> cut me a junk o that says he for i haven t no knife and hardly strength enough so be as i had
<s> ah jim jim i reckon i ve missed stays cut me a quid as ll likely be the last lad for i m for my long home and no mistake
<s> well said i i ll cut you some tobacco but if i was you and thought myself so badly i would go to my prayers like a christian man
<s> why said he
<s> now you tell me why
<s> why i cried
<s> you were asking me just now about the dead
<s> you ve broken your trust you ve lived in sin and lies and blood there s a man you killed lying at your feet this moment and you ask me why for god s mercy mr
<s> hands that s why
<s> i spoke with a little heat thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed in his ill thoughts to end me with
<s> he for his part took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity
<s> for thirty years he said i ve sailed the seas and seen good and bad better and worse fair weather and foul provisions running out knives going and what not
<s> well now i tell you i never seen good come o goodness yet
<s> him as strikes first is my fancy dead men don t bite them s my views amen so be it
<s> and now you look here he added suddenly changing his tone we ve had about enough of this foolery
<s> the tide s made good enough by now
<s> you just take my orders cap n hawkins and we ll sail slap in and be done with it
<s> all told we had scarce two miles to run but the navigation was delicate the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal but lay east and west so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in
<s> i think i was a good prompt subaltern and i am very sure that hands was an excellent pilot for we went about and about and dodged in shaving the banks with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold
<s> scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us
<s> the shores of north inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage but the space was longer and narrower and more like what in truth it was the estuary of a river
<s> right before us at the southern end we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation
<s> it had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers
<s> it was a sad sight but it showed us that the anchorage was calm
<s> now said hands look there there s a pet bit for to beach a ship in
<s> fine flat sand never a cat s paw trees all around of it and flowers a blowing like a garding on that old ship
<s> and once beached i inquired how shall we get her off again
<s> why so he replied you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water take a turn about one of them big pines bring it back take a turn around the capstan and lie to for the tide
<s> come high water all hands take a pull upon the line and off she comes as sweet as natur
<s> and now boy you stand by
<s> we re near the bit now and she s too much way on her
<s> starboard a little so steady starboard larboard a little steady steady
<s> so he issued his commands which i breathlessly obeyed till all of a sudden he cried now my hearty luff and i put the helm hard up and the hispaniola swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low wooded shore
<s> the excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch i had kept hitherto sharply enough upon the coxswain
<s> even then i was still so much interested waiting for the ship to touch that i had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows
<s> i might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head
<s> perhaps i had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye perhaps it was an instinct like a cat s but sure enough when i looked round there was hands already half way towards me with the dirk in his right hand
<s> we must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met but while mine was the shrill cry of terror his was a roar of fury like a charging bully s
<s> at the same instant he threw himself forward and i leapt sideways towards the bows
<s> as i did so i let go of the tiller which sprang sharp to leeward and i think this saved my life for it struck hands across the chest and stopped him for the moment dead
<s> before he could recover i was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped with all the deck to dodge about
<s> just forward of the main mast i stopped drew a pistol from my pocket took a cool aim though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me and drew the trigger
<s> the hammer fell but there followed neither flash nor sound the priming was useless with sea water
<s> i cursed myself for my neglect
<s> why had not i long before reprimed and reloaded my only weapons then i should not have been as now a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher
<s> wounded as he was it was wonderful how fast he could move his grizzled hair tumbling over his face and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury
<s> i had no time to try my other pistol nor indeed much inclination for i was sure it would be useless
<s> one thing i saw plainly i must not simply retreat before him or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern
<s> once so caught and nine or ten inches of the blood stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity
<s> i placed my palms against the main mast which was of a goodish bigness and waited every nerve upon the stretch
<s> seeing that i meant to dodge he also paused and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine
<s> it was such a game as i had often played at home about the rocks of black hill cove but never before you may be sure with such a wildly beating heart as now
<s> still as i say it was a boy s game and i thought i could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh
<s> indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that i allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair and while i saw certainly that i could spin it out for long i saw no hope of any ultimate escape
<s> well while things stood thus suddenly the hispaniola struck staggered ground for an instant in the sand and then swift as a blow canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay in a pool between the deck and bulwark
<s> we were both of us capsized in a second and both of us rolled almost together into the scuppers the dead red cap with his arms still spread out tumbling stiffly after us
<s> so near were we indeed that my head came against the coxswain s foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle
<s> blow and all i was the first afoot again for hands had got involved with the dead body
<s> the sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on i had to find some new way of escape and that upon the instant for my foe was almost touching me
<s> quick as thought i sprang into the mizzen shrouds rattled up hand over hand and did not draw a breath till i was seated on the cross trees
<s> i had been saved by being prompt the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as i pursued my upward flight and there stood israel hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment
<s> now that i had a moment to myself i lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol and then having one ready for service and to make assurance doubly sure i proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning
<s> my new employment struck hands all of a heap he began to see the dice going against him and after an obvious hesitation he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds and with the dirk in his teeth began slowly and painfully to mount
<s> it cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him and i had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up
<s> then with a pistol in either hand i addressed him
<s> one more step mr
<s> hands said i and i ll blow your brains out dead men don t bite you know i added with a chuckle
<s> he stopped instantly
<s> i could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think and the process was so slow and laborious that in my new found security i laughed aloud
<s> at last with a swallow or two he spoke his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity
<s> in order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth but in all else he remained unmoved
<s> jim says he i reckon we re fouled you and me and we ll have to sign articles
<s> i d have had you but for that there lurch but i don t have no luck not i and i reckon i ll have to strike which comes hard you see for a master mariner to a ship s younker like you jim
<s> i was drinking in his words and smiling away as conceited as a cock upon a wall when all in a breath back went his right hand over his shoulder
<s> something sang like an arrow through the air i felt a blow and then a sharp pang and there i was pinned by the shoulder to the mast
<s> in the horrid pain and surprise of the moment i scarce can say it was by my own volition and i am sure it was without a conscious aim both my pistols went off and both escaped out of my hands
<s> they did not fall alone with a choked cry the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water
<s> 0219m
<s> 0247m
<s> 27
<s> 0251m
<s> pieces of eight
<s> 9251m
<s> wing to the cant of the vessel the masts hung far out over the water and from my perch on the cross trees i had nothing below me but the surface of the bay
<s> hands who was not so far up was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks
<s> he rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good
<s> as the water settled i could see him lying huddled together on the clean bright sand in the shadow of the vessel s sides
<s> a fish or two whipped past his body
<s> sometimes by the quivering of the water he appeared to move a little as if he were trying to rise
<s> but he was dead enough for all that being both shot and drowned and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter
<s> i was no sooner certain of this than i began to feel sick faint and terrified
<s> the hot blood was running over my back and chest
<s> the dirk where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast seemed to burn like a hot iron yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me for these it seemed to me i could bear without a murmur it was the horror i had upon my mind of falling from the cross trees into that still green water beside the body of the coxswain
<s> i clung with both hands till my nails ached and i shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril
<s> gradually my mind came back again my pulses quieted down to a more natural time and i was once more in possession of myself
<s> it was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me and i desisted with a violent shudder
<s> oddly enough that very shudder did the business
<s> the knife in fact had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether it held me by a mere pinch of skin and this the shudder tore away
<s> the blood ran down the faster to be sure but i was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt
<s> these last i broke through with a sudden jerk and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds
<s> for nothing in the world would i have again ventured shaken as i was upon the overhanging port shrouds from which israel had so lately fallen
<s> i went below and did what i could for my wound it pained me a good deal and still bled freely but it was neither deep nor dangerous nor did it greatly gall me when i used my arm
<s> then i looked around me and as the ship was now in a sense my own i began to think of clearing it from its last passenger the dead man o brien
<s> he had pitched as i have said against the bulwarks where he lay like some horrible ungainly sort of puppet life size indeed but how different from life s colour or life s comeliness in that position i could easily have my way with him and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead i took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave tumbled him overboard
<s> he went in with a sounding plunge the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface and as soon as the splash subsided i could see him and israel lying side by side both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water
<s> o brien though still quite a young man was very bald
<s> there he lay with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both
<s> i was now alone upon the ship the tide had just turned
<s> the sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck
<s> the evening breeze had sprung up and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro
<s> i began to see a danger to the ship
<s> the jibs i speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck but the main sail was a harder matter
<s> of course when the schooner canted over the boom had swung out board and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water
<s> i thought this made it still more dangerous yet the strain was so heavy that i half feared to meddle
<s> at last i got my knife and cut the halyards
<s> the peak dropped instantly a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water and since pull as i liked i could not budge the downhall that was the extent of what i could accomplish
<s> for the rest the hispaniola must trust to luck like myself
<s> by this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow the last rays i remember falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck
<s> it began to be chill the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward the schooner settling more and more on her beam ends
<s> i scrambled forward and looked over
<s> it seemed shallow enough and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security i let myself drop softly overboard
<s> the water scarcely reached my waist the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks and i waded ashore in great spirits leaving the hispaniola on her side with her main sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay
<s> about the same time the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines
<s> at least and at last i was off the sea nor had i returned thence empty handed
<s> there lay the schooner clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again
<s> i had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements
<s> possibly i might be blamed a bit for my truantry but the recapture of the hispaniola was a clenching answer and i hoped that even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time
<s> so thinking and in famous spirits i began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions
<s> i remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into captain kidd s anchorage ran from the two peaked hill upon my left and i bent my course in that direction that i might pass the stream while it was small
<s> the wood was pretty open and keeping along the lower spurs i had soon turned the corner of that hill and not long after waded to the mid calf across the watercourse
<s> this brought me near to where i had encountered ben gunn the maroon and i walked more circumspectly keeping an eye on every side
<s> the dusk had come nigh hand completely and as i opened out the cleft between the two peaks i became aware of a wavering glow against the sky where as i judged the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire
<s> and yet i wondered in my heart that he should show himself so careless
<s> for if i could see this radiance might it not reach the eyes of silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes
<s> gradually the night fell blacker it was all i could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination the double hill behind me and the spy glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter the stars were few and pale and in the low ground where i wandered i kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits
<s> suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me
<s> i looked up a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the spy glass and soon after i saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees and knew the moon had risen
<s> with this to help me i passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey and sometimes walking sometimes running impatiently drew near to the stockade
<s> yet as i began to thread the grove that lies before it i was not so thoughtless but that i slacked my pace and went a trifle warily
<s> it would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake
<s> the moon was climbing higher and higher its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees
<s> it was red and hot and now and again it was a little darkened as it were the embers of a bonfire smouldering
<s> for the life of me i could not think what it might be
<s> at last i came right down upon the borders of the clearing
<s> the western end was already steeped in moonshine the rest and the block house itself still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light
<s> on the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady red reverberation contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon
<s> there was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze
<s> i stopped with much wonder in my heart and perhaps a little terror also
<s> it had not been our way to build great fires we were indeed by the captain s orders somewhat niggardly of firewood and i began to fear that something had gone wrong while i was absent
<s> i stole round by the eastern end keeping close in shadow and at a convenient place where the darkness was thickest crossed the palisade
<s> to make assurance surer i got upon my hands and knees and crawled without a sound towards the corner of the house
<s> as i drew nearer my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened
<s> it is not a pleasant noise in itself and i have often complained of it at other times but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep
<s> the sea cry of the watch that beautiful all s well never fell more reassuringly on my ear
<s> in the meantime there was no doubt of one thing they kept an infamous bad watch
<s> if it had been silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them not a soul would have seen daybreak
<s> that was what it was thought i to have the captain wounded and again i blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard
<s> by this time i had got to the door and stood up
<s> all was dark within so that i could distinguish nothing by the eye
<s> as for sounds there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise a flickering or pecking that i could in no way account for
<s> with my arms before me i walked steadily in
<s> i should lie down in my own place i thought with a silent chuckle and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning
<s> 0255m
<s> my foot struck something yielding it was a sleeper s leg and he turned and groaned but without awaking
<s> and then all of a sudden a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness
<s> pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight pieces of eight and so forth without pause or change like the clacking of a tiny mill
<s> silver s green parrot captain flint it was she whom i had heard pecking at a piece of bark it was she keeping better watch than any human being who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain
<s> i had no time left me to recover
<s> at the sharp clipping tone of the parrot the sleepers awoke and sprang up and with a mighty oath the voice of silver cried who goes
<s> i turned to run struck violently against one person recoiled and ran full into the arms of a second who for his part closed upon and held me tight
<s> bring a torch dick said silver when my capture was thus assured
<s> and one of the men left the log house and presently returned with a lighted brand
<s> 0259m
<s> part six captain silver
<s> 28
<s> 0261m
<s> in the enemy s camp
<s> 9261m
<s> he red glare of the torch lighting up the interior of the block house showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized
<s> the pirates were in possession of the house and stores there was the cask of cognac there were the pork and bread as before and what tenfold increased my horror not a sign of any prisoner
<s> i could only judge that all had perished and my heart smote me sorely that i had not been there to perish with them
<s> there were six of the buccaneers all told not another man was left alive
<s> five of them were on their feet flushed and swollen suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness
<s> the sixth had only risen upon his elbow he was deadly pale and the blood stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded and still more recently dressed
<s> i remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack and doubted not that this was he
<s> the parrot sat preening her plumage on long john s shoulder
<s> he himself i thought looked somewhat paler and more stern than i was used to
<s> he still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission but it was bitterly the worse for wear daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood
<s> so said he here s jim hawkins shiver my timbers dropped in like eh well come i take that friendly
<s> and thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe
<s> give me a loan of the link dick said he and then when he had a good light that ll do lad he added stick the glim in the wood heap and you gentlemen bring yourselves to you needn t stand up for mr
<s> hawkins he ll excuse you you may lay to that
<s> and so jim stopping the tobacco here you were and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old john
<s> i see you were smart when first i set my eyes on you but this here gets away from me clean it do
<s> to all this as may be well supposed i made no answer
<s> they had set me with my back against the wall and i stood there looking silver in the face pluckily enough i hope to all outward appearance but with black despair in my heart
<s> silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again
<s> now you see jim so be as you are here says he i ll give you a piece of my mind
<s> i ve always liked you i have for a lad of spirit and the picter of my own self when i was young and handsome
<s> i always wanted you to jine and take your share and die a gentleman and now my cock you ve got to
<s> cap n smollett s a fine seaman as i ll own up to any day but stiff on discipline
<s> dooty is dooty says he and right he is
<s> just you keep clear of the cap n
<s> the doctor himself is gone dead again you ungrateful scamp was what he said and the short and the long of the whole story is about here you can t go back to your own lot for they won t have you and without you start a third ship s company all by yourself which might be lonely you ll have to jine with cap n silver
<s> so far so good
<s> my friends then were still alive and though i partly believed the truth of silver s statement that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion i was more relieved than distressed by what i heard
<s> i don t say nothing as to your being in our hands continued silver though there you are and you may lay to it
<s> i m all for argyment i never seen good come out o threatening
<s> if you like the service well you ll jine and if you don t jim why you re free to answer no free and welcome shipmate and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman shiver my sides
<s> am i to answer then i asked with a very tremulous voice
<s> through all this sneering talk i was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast
<s> lad said silver no one s a pressing of you
<s> take your bearings
<s> none of us won t hurry you mate time goes so pleasant in your company you see
<s> well says i growing a bit bolder if i m to choose i declare i have a right to know what s what and why you re here and where my friends are
<s> wot s wot repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl
<s> ah he d be a lucky one as knowed that
<s> you ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you re spoke to my friend cried silver truculently to this speaker
<s> and then in his first gracious tones he replied to me yesterday morning mr
<s> hawkins said he in the dog watch down came doctor livesey with a flag of truce
<s> says he cap n silver you re sold out
<s> ship s gone
<s> well maybe we d been taking a glass and a song to help it round
<s> i won t say no
<s> leastways none of us had looked out
<s> we looked out and by thunder the old ship was gone i never seen a pack o fools look fishier and you may lay to that if i tells you that looked the fishiest
<s> well says the doctor let s bargain
<s> we bargained him and i and here we are stores brandy block house the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut and in a manner of speaking the whole blessed boat from cross trees to kelson
<s> as for them they ve tramped i don t know where s they are
<s> he drew again quietly at his pipe
<s> and lest you should take it into that head of yours he went on that you was included in the treaty here s the last word that was said how many are you says i to leave four says he four and one of us wounded
<s> as for that boy i don t know where he is confound him says he nor i don t much care
<s> we re about sick of him
<s> these was his words
<s> is that all i asked
<s> well it s all that you re to hear my son returned silver
<s> and now i am to choose
<s> and now you are to choose and you may lay to that said silver
<s> well said i i am not such a fool but i know pretty well what i have to look for
<s> let the worst come to the worst it s little i care
<s> i ve seen too many die since i fell in with you
<s> but there s a thing or two i have to tell you i said and by this time i was quite excited and the first is this here you are in a bad way ship lost treasure lost men lost your whole business gone to wreck and if you want to know who did it it was i i was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land and i heard you john and you dick johnson and hands who is now at the bottom of the sea and told every word you said before the hour was out
<s> and as for the schooner it was i who cut her cable and it was i that killed the men you had aboard of her and it was i who brought her where you ll never see her more not one of you
<s> the laugh s on my side i ve had the top of this business from the first i no more fear you than i fear a fly
<s> kill me if you please or spare me
<s> but one thing i ll say and no more if you spare me bygones are bygones and when you fellows are in court for piracy i ll save you all i can
<s> it is for you to choose
<s> kill another and do yourselves no good or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows
<s> i stopped for i tell you i was out of breath and to my wonder not a man of them moved but all sat staring at me like as many sheep
<s> and while they were still staring i broke out again and now mr
<s> silver i said i believe you re the best man here and if things go to the worst i ll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way i took it
<s> i ll bear it in mind said silver with an accent so curious that i could not for the life of me decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage
<s> i ll put one to that cried the old mahogany faced seaman morgan by name whom i had seen in long john s public house upon the quays of bristol
<s> it was him that knowed black dog
<s> well and see here added the sea cook
<s> i ll put another again to that by thunder for it was this same boy that faked the chart from billy bones
<s> first and last we ve split upon jim hawkins
<s> then here goes said morgan with an oath
<s> and he sprang up drawing his knife as if he had been twenty
<s> avast there cried silver
<s> who are you tom morgan maybe you thought you was cap n here perhaps
<s> by the powers but i ll teach you better cross me and you ll go where many a good man s gone before you first and last these thirty year back some to the yard arm shiver my timbers and some by the board and all to feed the fishes
<s> there s never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a terwards tom morgan you may lay to that
<s> morgan paused but a hoarse murmur rose from the others
<s> tom s right said one
<s> i stood hazing long enough from one added another
<s> i ll be hanged if i ll be hazed by you john silver
<s> did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me roared silver bending far forward from his position on the keg with his pipe still glowing in his right hand
<s> put a name on what you re at you ain t dumb i reckon
<s> him that wants shall get it
<s> have i lived this many years and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it you know the way you re all gentlemen o fortune by your account
<s> well i m ready
<s> take a cutlass him that dares and i ll see the colour of his inside crutch and all before that pipe s empty
<s> 0267m
<s> not a man stirred not a man answered
<s> that s your sort is it he added returning his pipe to his mouth
<s> well you re a gay lot to look at anyway
<s> not much worth to fight you ain t
<s> p r aps you can understand king george s english
<s> i m cap n here by lection
<s> i m cap n here because i m the best man by a long sea mile
<s> you won t fight as gentlemen o fortune should then by thunder you ll obey and you may lay to it i like that boy now i never seen a better boy than that
<s> he s more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house and what i say is this let me see him that ll lay a hand on him that s what i say and you may lay to it
<s> there was a long pause after this
<s> i stood straight up against the wall my heart still going like a sledge hammer but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom
<s> silver leant back against the wall his arms crossed his pipe in the corner of his mouth as calm as though he had been in church yet his eye kept wandering furtively and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers
<s> they on their part drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously like a stream
<s> one after another they would look up and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces but it was not towards me it was towards silver that they turned their eyes
<s> you seem to have a lot to say remarked silver spitting far into the air
<s> pipe up and let me hear it or lay to
<s> ax your pardon sir returned one of the men you re pretty free with some of the rules maybe you ll kindly keep an eye upon the rest
<s> this crew s dissatisfied this crew don t vally bullying a marlin spike this crew has its rights like other crews i ll make so free as that and by your own rules i take it we can talk together
<s> i ax your pardon sir acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present but i claim my right and steps outside for a council
<s> and with an elaborate sea salute this fellow a long ill looking yellow eyed man of five and thirty stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house
<s> one after another the rest followed his example each making a salute as he passed each adding some apology
<s> according to rules said one
<s> forecastle council said morgan
<s> and so with one remark or another all marched out and left silver and me alone with the torch
<s> the sea cook instantly removed his pipe
<s> now look you here jim hawkins he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible you re within half a plank of death and what s a long sight worse of torture
<s> they re going to throw me off
<s> but you mark i stand by you through thick and thin
<s> i didn t mean to no not till you spoke up
<s> i was about desperate to lose that much blunt and be hanged into the bargain
<s> but i see you was the right sort
<s> i says to myself you stand by hawkins john and hawkins ll stand by you
<s> you re his last card and by the living thunder john he s yours back to back says i
<s> you save your witness and he ll save your neck
<s> i began dimly to understand
<s> you mean all s lost i asked
<s> aye by gum i do he answered
<s> ship gone neck gone that s the size of it
<s> once i looked into that bay jim hawkins and seen no schooner well i m tough but i gave out
<s> as for that lot and their council mark me they re outright fools and cowards
<s> i ll save your life if so be as i can from them
<s> but see here jim tit for tat you save long john from swinging
<s> i was bewildered it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking he the old buccaneer the ringleader throughout
<s> what i can do that i ll do i said
<s> it s a bargain cried long john
<s> you speak up plucky and by thunder i ve a chance
<s> he hobbled to the torch where it stood propped among the firewood and took a fresh light to his pipe
<s> understand me jim he said returning
<s> i ve a head on my shoulders i have
<s> i m on squire s side now
<s> i know you ve got that ship safe somewheres
<s> how you done it i don t know but safe it is
<s> i guess hands and o brien turned soft
<s> i never much believed in neither of them
<s> now you mark me
<s> i ask no questions nor i won t let others
<s> i know when a game s up i do and i know a lad that s staunch
<s> ah you that s young you and me might have done a power of good together
<s> he drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin
<s> will you taste messmate he asked and when i had refused well i ll take a dram myself jim said he
<s> i need a caulker for there s trouble on hand
<s> and talking o trouble why did that doctor give me the chart jim
<s> my face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions
<s> ah well he did though said he
<s> and there s something under that no doubt something surely under that jim bad or good
<s> and he took another swallow of the brandy shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst
<s> 29
<s> 0271m
<s> the black spot again
<s> 9271m
<s> he council of buccaneers had lasted some time when one of them re entered the house and with a repetition of the same salute which had in my eyes an ironical air begged for a moment s loan of the torch
<s> silver briefly agreed and this emissary retired again leaving us together in the dark
<s> there s a breeze coming jim said silver who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone
<s> i turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out
<s> the embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that i understood why these conspirators desired a torch
<s> about half way down the slope to the stockade they were collected in a group one held the light another was on his knees in their midst and i saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight
<s> the rest were all somewhat stooping as though watching the manoeuvres of this last
<s> i could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house
<s> 0273m
<s> here they come said i and i returned to my former position for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them
<s> well let em come lad let em come said silver cheerily
<s> i ve still a shot in my locker
<s> the door opened and the five men standing huddled together just inside pushed one of their number forward
<s> in any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance hesitating as he set down each foot but holding his closed right hand in front of him
<s> step up lad cried silver
<s> i won t eat you
<s> hand it over lubber
<s> i know the rules i do i won t hurt a depytation
<s> thus encouraged the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly and having passed something to silver from hand to hand slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions
<s> the sea cook looked at what had been given him
<s> the black spot i thought so he observed
<s> where might you have got the paper why hillo look here now this ain t lucky you ve gone and cut this out of a bible
<s> what fool s cut a bible
<s> ah there said morgan
<s> there wot did i say no good ll come o that i said
<s> well you ve about fixed it now among you continued silver
<s> you ll all swing now i reckon
<s> what soft headed lubber had a bible
<s> it was dick said one
<s> dick was it then dick can get to prayers said silver
<s> he s seen his slice of luck has dick and you may lay to that
<s> but here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in
<s> belay that talk john silver he said
<s> this crew has tipped you the black spot in full council as in dooty bound just you turn it over as in dooty bound and see what s wrote there
<s> then you can talk
<s> thanky george replied the sea cook
<s> you always was brisk for business and has the rules by heart george as i m pleased to see
<s> well what is it anyway ah deposed that s it is it very pretty wrote to be sure like print i swear
<s> your hand o write george why you was gettin quite a leadin man in this here crew
<s> you ll be cap n next i shouldn t wonder
<s> just oblige me with that torch again will you this pipe don t draw
<s> come now said george you don t fool this crew no more
<s> you re a funny man by your account but you re over now and you ll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote
<s> i thought you said you knowed the rules returned silver contemptuously
<s> leastways if you don t i do and i wait here and i m still your cap n mind till you outs with your grievances and i reply in the meantime your black spot ain t worth a biscuit
<s> after that we ll see
<s> oh replied george you don t be under no kind of apprehension we re all square we are
<s> first you ve made a hash of this cruise you ll be a bold man to say no to that
<s> second you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing
<s> why did they want out i dunno but it s pretty plain they wanted it
<s> third you wouldn t let us go at them upon the march
<s> oh we see through you john silver you want to play booty that s what s wrong with you
<s> and then fourth there s this here boy
<s> is that all asked silver quietly
<s> enough too retorted george
<s> we ll all swing and sun dry for your bungling
<s> well now look here i ll answer these four p ints one after another i ll answer em
<s> i made a hash o this cruise did i well now you all know what i wanted and you all know if that had been done that we d a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was every man of us alive and fit and full of good plum duff and the treasure in the hold of her by thunder well who crossed me who forced my hand as was the lawful cap n who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance ah it s a fine dance i m with you there and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope s end at execution dock by london town it does
<s> but who done it why it was anderson and hands and you george merry and you re the last above board of that same meddling crew and you have the davy jones s insolence to up and stand for cap n over me you that sank the lot of us by the powers but this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing
<s> silver paused and i could see by the faces of george and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain
<s> that s for number one cried the accused wiping the sweat from his brow for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house
<s> why i give you my word i m sick to speak to you
<s> you ve neither sense nor memory and i leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea
<s> sea gentlemen o fortune i reckon tailors is your trade
<s> go on john said morgan
<s> speak up to the others
<s> ah the others returned john
<s> they re a nice lot ain t they you say this cruise is bungled
<s> ah by gum if you could understand how bad it s bungled you would see we re that near the gibbet that my neck s stiff with thinking on it
<s> you ve seen em maybe hanged in chains birds about em seamen p inting em out as they go down with the tide
<s> who s that says one
<s> that why that s john silver
<s> i knowed him well says another
<s> and you can hear the chains a jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy
<s> now that s about where we are every mother s son of us thanks to him and hands and anderson and other ruination fools of you
<s> and if you want to know about number four and that boy why shiver my timbers isn t he a hostage are we a going to waste a hostage no not us he might be our last chance and i shouldn t wonder
<s> kill that boy not me mates and number three ah well there s a deal to say to number three
<s> maybe you don t count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day you john with your head broke or you george merry that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock and maybe perhaps you didn t know there was a consort coming either but there is and not so long till then and we ll see who ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that
<s> and as for number two and why i made a bargain well you came crawling on your knees to me to make it on your knees you came you was that downhearted and you d have starved too if i hadn t but that s a trifle you look there that s why
<s> and he cast down upon the floor a paper that i instantly recognized none other than the chart on yellow paper with the three red crosses that i had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain s chest
<s> why the doctor had given it to him was more than i could fancy
<s> but if it were inexplicable to me the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers
<s> they leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse
<s> it went from hand to hand one tearing it from another and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination you would have thought not only they were fingering the very gold but were at sea with it besides in safety
<s> yes said one that s flint sure enough
<s> j
<s> f
<s> and a score below with a clove hitch to it so he done ever
<s> mighty pretty said george
<s> but how are we to get away with it and us no ship
<s> silver suddenly sprang up and supporting himself with a hand against the wall now i give you warning george he cried
<s> one more word of your sauce and i ll call you down and fight you
<s> how why how do i know you had ought to tell me that you and the rest that lost me my schooner with your interference burn you but not you you can t you hain t got the invention of a cockroach
<s> but civil you can speak and shall george merry you may lay to that
<s> that s fair enow said the old man morgan
<s> fair i reckon so said the sea cook
<s> you lost the ship i found the treasure
<s> who s the better man at that and now i resign by thunder elect whom you please to be your cap n now i m done with it
<s> silver they cried
<s> barbecue forever barbecue for cap n
<s> so that s the toon is it cried the cook
<s> george i reckon you ll have to wait another turn friend and lucky for you as i m not a revengeful man
<s> but that was never my way
<s> and now shipmates this black spot tain t much good now is it dick s crossed his luck and spoiled his bible and that s about all
<s> it ll do to kiss the book on still won t it growled dick who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself
<s> a bible with a bit cut out returned silver derisively
<s> not it
<s> it don t bind no more n a ballad book
<s> don t it though cried dick with a sort of joy
<s> well i reckon that s worth having too
<s> here jim here s a cur osity for you said silver and he tossed me the paper
<s> it was around about the size of a crown piece
<s> one side was blank for it had been the last leaf the other contained a verse or two of revelation these words among the rest which struck sharply home upon my mind without are dogs and murderers
<s> the printed side had been blackened with wood ash which already began to come off and soil my fingers on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word depposed
<s> i have that curiosity beside me at this moment but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch such as a man might make with his thumb nail
<s> that was the end of the night s business
<s> soon after with a drink all round we lay down to sleep and the outside of silver s vengeance was to put george merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful
<s> it was long ere i could close an eye and heaven knows i had matter enough for thought in the man whom i had slain that afternoon in my own most perilous position and above all in the remarkable game that i saw silver now engaged upon keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means possible and impossible to make his peace and save his miserable life
<s> he himself slept peacefully and snored aloud yet my heart was sore for him wicked as he was to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him
<s> 30
<s> 0280m
<s> on parole
<s> 9280m
<s> was wakened indeed we were all wakened for i could see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the door post by a clear hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the wood
<s> block house ahoy it cried
<s> here s the doctor
<s> and the doctor it was
<s> although i was glad to hear the sound yet my gladness was not without admixture
<s> i remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct and when i saw where it had brought me among what companions and surrounded by what dangers i felt ashamed to look him in the face
<s> he must have risen in the dark for the day had hardly come and when i ran to a loophole and looked out i saw him standing like silver once before up to the mid leg in creeping vapour
<s> you doctor top o the morning to you sir cried silver broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment
<s> bright and early to be sure and it s the early bird as the saying goes that gets the rations
<s> george shake up your timbers son and help dr
<s> livesey over the ship s side
<s> all a doin well your patients was all well and merry
<s> so he pattered on standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his elbow and one hand upon the side of the log house quite the old john in voice manner and expression
<s> we ve quite a surprise for you too sir he continued
<s> we ve a little stranger here he he a noo boarder and lodger sir and looking fit and taut as a fiddle slep like a supercargo he did right alongside of john stem to stem we was all night
<s> dr
<s> livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook and i could hear the alteration in his voice as he said not jim
<s> the very same jim as ever was says silver
<s> the doctor stopped outright although he did not speak and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on
<s> well well he said at last duty first and pleasure afterwards as you might have said yourself silver
<s> let us overhaul these patients of yours
<s> a moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick
<s> he seemed under no apprehension though he must have known that his life among these treacherous demons depended on a hair and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet english family
<s> his manner i suppose reacted on the men for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred as if he were still ship s doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast
<s> you re doing well my friend he said to the fellow with the bandaged head and if ever any person had a close shave it was you your head must be as hard as iron
<s> well george how goes it you re a pretty colour certainly why your liver man is upside down
<s> did you take that medicine did he take that medicine men
<s> aye aye sir he took it sure enough returned morgan
<s> because you see since i am mutineers doctor or prison doctor as i prefer to call it says doctor livesey in his pleasantest way i make it a point of honour not to lose a man for king george god bless him and the gallows
<s> the rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home thrust in silence
<s> dick don t feel well sir said one
<s> don t he replied the doctor
<s> well step up here dick and let me see your tongue
<s> no i should be surprised if he did the man s tongue is fit to frighten the french
<s> another fever
<s> ah there said morgan that comed of sp iling bibles
<s> that comes as you call it of being arrant asses retorted the doctor and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison and the dry land from a vile pestiferous slough
<s> i think it most probable though of course it s only an opinion that you ll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems
<s> camp in a bog would you silver i m surprised at you
<s> you re less of a fool than many take you all round but you don t appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health
<s> well he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions with really laughable humility more like charity schoolchildren than blood guilty mutineers and pirates well that s done for today
<s> and now i should wish to have a talk with that boy please
<s> and he nodded his head in my direction carelessly
<s> george merry was at the door spitting and spluttering over some bad tasted medicine but at the first word of the doctor s proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried no and swore
<s> silver struck the barrel with his open hand
<s> si lence he roared and looked about him positively like a lion
<s> doctor he went on in his usual tones i was a thinking of that knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy
<s> we re all humbly grateful for your kindness and as you see puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog
<s> and i take it i ve found a way as ll suit all
<s> hawkins will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman for a young gentleman you are although poor born your word of honour not to slip your cable
<s> i readily gave the pledge required
<s> then doctor said silver you just step outside o that stockade and once you re there i ll bring the boy down on the inside and i reckon you can yarn through the spars
<s> good day to you sir and all our dooties to the squire and cap n smollett
<s> the explosion of disapproval which nothing but silver s black looks had restrained broke out immediately the doctor had left the house
<s> silver was roundly accused of playing double of trying to make a separate peace for himself of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims and in one word of the identical exact thing that he was doing
<s> it seemed to me so obvious in this case that i could not imagine how he was to turn their anger
<s> but he was twice the man the rest were and his last night s victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds
<s> he called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine said it was necessary i should talk to the doctor fluttered the chart in their faces asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a treasure hunting
<s> no by thunder he cried
<s> it s us must break the treaty when the time comes and till then i ll gammon that doctor if i have to ile his boots with brandy
<s> and then he bade them get the fire lit and stalked out upon his crutch with his hand on my shoulder leaving them in a disarray and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced
<s> slow lad slow he said
<s> they might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry
<s> very deliberately then did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance silver stopped
<s> you ll make a note of this here also doctor says he and the boy ll tell you how i saved his life and were deposed for it too and you may lay to that
<s> doctor when a man s steering as near the wind as me playing chuck farthing with the last breath in his body like you wouldn t think it too much mayhap to give him one good word you ll please bear in mind it s not my life only now it s that boy s into the bargain and you ll speak me fair doctor and give me a bit o hope to go on for the sake of mercy
<s> silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house his cheeks seemed to have fallen in his voice trembled never was a soul more dead in earnest
<s> why john you re not afraid asked dr
<s> livesey
<s> doctor i m no coward no not i not so much and he snapped his fingers
<s> if i was i wouldn t say it
<s> but i ll own up fairly i ve the shakes upon me for the gallows
<s> you re a good man and a true i never seen a better man and you ll not forget what i done good not any more than you ll forget the bad i know
<s> and i step aside see here and leave you and jim alone
<s> and you ll put that down for me too for it s a long stretch is that
<s> so saying he stepped back a little way till he was out of earshot and there sat down upon a tree stump and began to whistle spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire which they were busy rekindling and the house from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast
<s> so jim said the doctor sadly here you are
<s> as you have brewed so shall you drink my boy
<s> heaven knows i cannot find it in my heart to blame you but this much i will say be it kind or unkind when captain smollett was well you dared not have gone off and when he was ill and couldn t help it by george it was downright cowardly
<s> i will own that i here began to weep
<s> doctor i said you might spare me
<s> i have blamed myself enough my life s forfeit anyway and i should have been dead by now if silver hadn t stood for me and doctor believe this i can die and i dare say i deserve it but what i fear is torture
<s> if they come to torture me
<s> jim the doctor interrupted and his voice was quite changed jim i can t have this
<s> whip over and we ll run for it
<s> doctor said i i passed my word
<s> i know i know he cried
<s> we can t help that jim now
<s> i ll take it on my shoulders holus bolus blame and shame my boy but stay here i cannot let you
<s> jump one jump and you re out and we ll run for it like antelopes
<s> 0285m
<s> no i replied you know right well you wouldn t do the thing yourself neither you nor squire nor captain and no more will i
<s> silver trusted me i passed my word and back i go
<s> but doctor you did not let me finish
<s> if they come to torture me i might let slip a word of where the ship is for i got the ship part by luck and part by risking and she lies in north inlet on the southern beach and just below high water
<s> at half tide she must be high and dry
<s> the ship exclaimed the doctor
<s> rapidly i described to him my adventures and he heard me out in silence
<s> there is a kind of fate in this he observed when i had done
<s> every step it s you that saves our lives and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours that would be a poor return my boy
<s> you found out the plot you found ben gunn the best deed that ever you did or will do though you live to ninety
<s> oh by jupiter and talking of ben gunn why this is the mischief in person
<s> silver he cried
<s> silver i ll give you a piece of advice he continued as the cook drew near again don t you be in any great hurry after that treasure
<s> why sir i do my possible which that ain t said silver
<s> i can only asking your pardon save my life and the boy s by seeking for that treasure and you may lay to that
<s> well silver replied the doctor if that is so i ll go one step further look out for squalls when you find it
<s> sir said silver as between man and man that s too much and too little
<s> what you re after why you left the block house why you given me that there chart i don t know now do i and yet i done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope but no this here s too much
<s> if you won t tell me what you mean plain out just say so and i ll leave the helm
<s> no said the doctor musingly i ve no right to say more it s not my secret you see silver or i give you my word i d tell it you
<s> but i ll go as far with you as i dare go and a step beyond for i ll have my wig sorted by the captain or i m mistaken and first i ll give you a bit of hope silver if we both get alive out of this wolf trap i ll do my best to save you short of perjury
<s> silver s face was radiant
<s> you couldn t say more i m sure sir not if you was my mother he cried
<s> well that s my first concession added the doctor
<s> my second is a piece of advice keep the boy close beside you and when you need help halloo
<s> i m off to seek it for you and that itself will show you if i speak at random
<s> good bye jim
<s> and dr
<s> livesey shook hands with me through the stockade nodded to silver and set off at a brisk pace into the wood
<s> 31
<s> 0289m
<s> the treasure hunt flint s pointer
<s> 9289m
<s> im said silver when we were alone if i saved your life you saved mine and i ll not forget it
<s> i seen the doctor waving you to run for it with the tail of my eye i did and i seen you say no as plain as hearing
<s> jim that s one to you
<s> this is the first glint of hope i had since the attack failed and i owe it you
<s> and now jim we re to go in for this here treasure hunting with sealed orders too and i don t like it and you and me must stick close back to back like and we ll save our necks in spite o fate and fortune
<s> just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk
<s> they had lit a fire fit to roast an ox and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward and even there not without precaution
<s> in the same wasteful spirit they had cooked i suppose three times more than we could eat and one of them with an empty laugh threw what was left into the fire which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel
<s> i never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it i could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign
<s> even silver eating away with captain flint upon his shoulder had not a word of blame for their recklessness
<s> and this the more surprised me for i thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then
<s> aye mates said he it s lucky you have barbecue to think for you with this here head
<s> i got what i wanted i did
<s> sure enough they have the ship
<s> where they have it i don t know yet but once we hit the treasure we ll have to jump about and find out
<s> and then mates us that has the boats i reckon has the upper hand
<s> thus he kept running on with his mouth full of the hot bacon thus he restored their hope and confidence and i more than suspect repaired his own at the same time
<s> as for hostage he continued that s his last talk i guess with them he loves so dear
<s> i ve got my piece o news and thanky to him for that but it s over and done
<s> i ll take him in a line when we go treasure hunting for we ll keep him like so much gold in case of accidents you mark and in the meantime
<s> once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions why then we ll talk mr
<s> hawkins over we will and we ll give him his share to be sure for all his kindness
<s> it was no wonder the men were in a good humour now
<s> for my part i was horribly cast down
<s> should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible silver already doubly a traitor would not hesitate to adopt it
<s> he had still a foot in either camp and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging which was the best he had to hope on our side
<s> nay and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with dr
<s> livesey even then what danger lay before us what a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and i should have to fight for dear life he a cripple and i a boy against five strong and active seamen
<s> add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends their unexplained desertion of the stockade their inexplicable cession of the chart or harder still to understand the doctor s last warning to silver look out for squalls when you find it and you will readily believe how little taste i found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart i set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure
<s> we made a curious figure had anyone been there to see us all in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth
<s> silver had two guns slung about him one before and one behind besides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square tailed coat
<s> to complete his strange appearance captain flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea talk
<s> i had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea cook who held the loose end of the rope now in his free hand now between his powerful teeth
<s> for all the world i was led like a dancing bear
<s> 0291m
<s> the other men were variously burthened some carrying picks and shovels for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the hispaniola others laden with pork bread and brandy for the midday meal
<s> all the stores i observed came from our stock and i could see the truth of silver s words the night before
<s> had he not struck a bargain with the doctor he and his mutineers deserted by the ship must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting
<s> water would have been little to their taste a sailor is not usually a good shot and besides all that when they were so short of eatables it was not likely they would be very flush of powder
<s> well thus equipped we all set out even the fellow with the broken head who should certainly have kept in shadow and straggled one after another to the beach where the two gigs awaited us
<s> even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates one in a broken thwart and both in their muddy and unbailed condition
<s> both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety and so with our numbers divided between them we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage
<s> as we pulled over there was some discussion on the chart
<s> the red cross was of course far too large to be a guide and the terms of the note on the back as you will hear admitted of some ambiguity
<s> they ran the reader may remember thus
<s> tall tree spy glass shoulder bearing a point to the n
<s> of n
<s> n
<s> e
<s> skeleton island e
<s> s
<s> e
<s> and by e
<s> ten feet
<s> a tall tree was thus the principal mark
<s> now right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the spy glass and rising again towards the south into the rough cliffy eminence called the mizzen mast hill
<s> the top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine trees of varying height
<s> every here and there one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours and which of these was the particular tall tree of captain flint could only be decided on the spot and by the readings of the compass
<s> yet although that was the case every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half way over long john alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there
<s> we pulled easily by silver s directions not to weary the hands prematurely and after quite a long passage landed at the mouth of the second river that which runs down a woody cleft of the spy glass
<s> thence bending to our left we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau
<s> at the first outset heavy miry ground and a matted marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order
<s> it was indeed a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching
<s> a heavy scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass
<s> thickets of green nutmeg trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others
<s> the air besides was fresh and stirring and this under the sheer sunbeams was a wonderful refreshment to our senses
<s> the party spread itself abroad in a fan shape shouting and leaping to and fro
<s> about the centre and a good way behind the rest silver and i followed i tethered by my rope he ploughing with deep pants among the sliding gravel
<s> from time to time indeed i had to lend him a hand or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill
<s> we had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud as if in terror
<s> shout after shout came from him and the others began to run in his direction
<s> he can t a found the treasure said old morgan hurrying past us from the right for that s clean a top
<s> indeed as we found when we also reached the spot it was something very different
<s> at the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones a human skeleton lay with a few shreds of clothing on the ground
<s> i believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart
<s> he was a seaman said george merry who bolder than the rest had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing
<s> leastways this is good sea cloth
<s> aye aye said silver like enough you wouldn t look to find a bishop here i reckon
<s> but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie tain t in natur
<s> indeed on a second glance it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position
<s> but for some disarray the work perhaps of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains the man lay perfectly straight his feet pointing in one direction his hands raised above his head like a diver s pointing directly in the opposite
<s> i ve taken a notion into my old numbskull observed silver
<s> here s the compass there s the tip top p int o skeleton island stickin out like a tooth
<s> just take a bearing will you along the line of them bones
<s> it was done
<s> the body pointed straight in the direction of the island and the compass read duly e
<s> s
<s> e
<s> and by e
<s> i thought so cried the cook this here is a p inter
<s> right up there is our line for the pole star and the jolly dollars
<s> but by thunder if it don t make me cold inside to think of flint
<s> this is one of his jokes and no mistake
<s> him and these six was alone here he killed em every man and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass shiver my timbers they re long bones and the hair s been yellow
<s> aye that would be allardyce
<s> you mind allardyce tom morgan
<s> aye aye returned morgan i mind him he owed me money he did and took my knife ashore with him
<s> speaking of knives said another why don t we find his n lying round flint warn t the man to pick a seaman s pocket and the birds i guess would leave it be
<s> by the powers and that s true cried silver
<s> there ain t a thing left here said merry still feeling round among the bones not a copper doit nor a baccy box
<s> it don t look nat ral to me
<s> no by gum it don t agreed silver not nat ral nor not nice says you
<s> great guns messmates but if flint was living this would be a hot spot for you and me
<s> six they were and six are we and bones is what they are now
<s> i saw him dead with these here deadlights said morgan
<s> billy took me in
<s> there he laid with penny pieces on his eyes
<s> dead aye sure enough he s dead and gone below said the fellow with the bandage but if ever sperrit walked it would be flint s
<s> dear heart but he died bad did flint
<s> aye that he did observed another now he raged and now he hollered for the rum and now he sang
<s> fifteen men were his only song mates and i tell you true i never rightly liked to hear it since
<s> it was main hot and the windy was open and i hear that old song comin out as clear as clear and the death haul on the man already
<s> come come said silver stow this talk
<s> he s dead and he don t walk that i know leastways he won t walk by day and you may lay to that
<s> care killed a cat
<s> fetch ahead for the doubloons
<s> we started certainly but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath
<s> the terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits
<s> 32
<s> 0298m
<s> the treasure hunt the voice among the trees
<s> 9298m
<s> artly from the damping influence of this alarm partly to rest silver and the sick folk the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent
<s> the plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand
<s> before us over the tree tops we beheld the cape of the woods fringed with surf behind we not only looked down upon the anchorage and skeleton island but saw clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands a great field of open sea upon the east
<s> sheer above us rose the spyglass here dotted with single pines there black with precipices
<s> there was no sound but that of the distant breakers mounting from all round and the chirp of countless insects in the brush
<s> not a man not a sail upon the sea the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude
<s> silver as he sat took certain bearings with his compass
<s> there are three tall trees said he about in the right line from skeleton island
<s> spy glass shoulder i take it means that lower p int there
<s> it s child s play to find the stuff now
<s> i ve half a mind to dine first
<s> i don t feel sharp growled morgan
<s> thinkin o flint i think it were as done me
<s> ah well my son you praise your stars he s dead said silver
<s> he were an ugly devil cried a third pirate with a shudder that blue in the face too
<s> that was how the rum took him added merry
<s> blue well i reckon he was blue
<s> that s a true word
<s> ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought they had spoken lower and lower and they had almost got to whispering by now so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood
<s> all of a sudden out of the middle of the trees in front of us a thin high trembling voice struck up the well known air and words
<s> fifteen men on the dead man s chest
<s> yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
<s> i never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates
<s> the colour went from their six faces like enchantment some leaped to their feet some clawed hold of others morgan grovelled on the ground
<s> it s flint by cried merry
<s> the song had stopped as suddenly as it began broken off you would have said in the middle of a note as though someone had laid his hand upon the singer s mouth
<s> coming through the clear sunny atmosphere among the green tree tops i thought it had sounded airily and sweetly and the effect on my companions was the stranger
<s> come said silver struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out this won t do
<s> stand by to go about
<s> this is a rum start and i can t name the voice but it s someone skylarking someone that s flesh and blood and you may lay to that
<s> his courage had come back as he spoke and some of the colour to his face along with it
<s> already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves when the same voice broke out again not this time singing but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the spy glass
<s> darby m graw it wailed for that is the word that best describes the sound darby m graw darby m graw again and again and again and then rising a little higher and with an oath that i leave out fetch aft the rum darby
<s> 0301m
<s> the buccaneers remained rooted to the ground their eyes starting from their heads
<s> long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence dreadfully before them
<s> that fixes it gasped one
<s> let s go
<s> they was his last words moaned morgan his last words above board
<s> dick had his bible out and was praying volubly
<s> he had been well brought up had dick before he came to sea and fell among bad companions
<s> still silver was unconquered
<s> i could hear his teeth rattle in his head but he had not yet surrendered
<s> nobody in this here island ever heard of darby he muttered not one but us that s here
<s> and then making a great effort shipmates he cried i m here to get that stuff and i ll not be beat by man or devil
<s> i never was feared of flint in his life and by the powers i ll face him dead
<s> there s seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here
<s> when did ever a gentleman o fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug and him dead too
<s> but there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers rather indeed of growing terror at the irreverence of his words
<s> belay there john said merry
<s> don t you cross a sperrit
<s> and the rest were all too terrified to reply
<s> they would have run away severally had they dared but fear kept them together and kept them close by john as if his daring helped them
<s> he on his part had pretty well fought his weakness down
<s> sperrit well maybe he said
<s> but there s one thing not clear to me
<s> there was an echo
<s> now no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow well then what s he doing with an echo to him i should like to know that ain t in natur surely
<s> this argument seemed weak enough to me
<s> but you can never tell what will affect the superstitious and to my wonder george merry was greatly relieved
<s> well that s so he said
<s> you ve a head upon your shoulders john and no mistake
<s> bout ship mates this here crew is on a wrong tack i do believe
<s> and come to think on it it was like flint s voice i grant you but not just so clear away like it after all
<s> it was liker somebody else s voice now it was liker
<s> by the powers ben gunn roared silver
<s> aye and so it were cried morgan springing on his knees
<s> ben gunn it were
<s> it don t make much odds do it now asked dick
<s> ben gunn s not here in the body any more n flint
<s> but the older hands greeted this remark with scorn
<s> why nobody minds ben gunn cried merry dead or alive nobody minds him
<s> it was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces
<s> soon they were chatting together with intervals of listening and not long after hearing no further sound they shouldered the tools and set forth again merry walking first with silver s compass to keep them on the right line with skeleton island
<s> he had said the truth dead or alive nobody minded ben gunn
<s> dick alone still held his bible and looked around him as he went with fearful glances but he found no sympathy and silver even joked him on his precautions
<s> i told you said he i told you you had sp iled your bible
<s> if it ain t no good to swear by what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it not that and he snapped his big fingers halting a moment on his crutch
<s> but dick was not to be comforted indeed it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick hastened by heat exhaustion and the shock of his alarm the fever predicted by dr
<s> livesey was evidently growing swiftly higher
<s> it was fine open walking here upon the summit our way lay a little downhill for as i have said the plateau tilted towards the west
<s> the pines great and small grew wide apart and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine
<s> striking as we did pretty near north west across the island we drew on the one hand ever nearer under the shoulders of the spy glass and on the other looked ever wider over that western bay where i had once tossed and trembled in the coracle
<s> the first of the tall trees was reached and by the bearings proved the wrong one
<s> so with the second
<s> the third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood a giant of a vegetable with a red column as big as a cottage and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred
<s> it was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart
<s> but it was not its size that now impressed my companions it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow
<s> the thought of the money as they drew nearer swallowed up their previous terrors
<s> their eyes burned in their heads their feet grew speedier and lighter their whole soul was bound up in that fortune that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure that lay waiting there for each of them
<s> silver hobbled grunting on his crutch his nostrils stood out and quivered he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look
<s> certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts and certainly i read them like print
<s> in the immediate nearness of the gold all else had been forgotten his promise and the doctor s warning were both things of the past and i could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure find and board the hispaniola under cover of night cut every honest throat about that island and sail away as he had at first intended laden with crimes and riches
<s> shaken as i was with these alarms it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasure hunters
<s> now and again i stumbled and it was then that silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances
<s> dick who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising
<s> this also added to my wretchedness and to crown all i was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face he who died at savannah singing and shouting for drink had there with his own hand cut down his six accomplices
<s> this grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries i thought and even with the thought i could believe i heard it ringing still
<s> we were now at the margin of the thicket
<s> huzza mates all together shouted merry and the foremost broke into a run
<s> and suddenly not ten yards further we beheld them stop
<s> a low cry arose
<s> silver doubled his pace digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed and next moment he and i had come also to a dead halt
<s> before us was a great excavation not very recent for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom
<s> in this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing cases strewn around
<s> on one of these boards i saw branded with a hot iron the name walrus the name of flint s ship
<s> all was clear to probation
<s> the cache had been found and rifled the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone
<s> 33
<s> 0306m
<s> the fall of a chieftain
<s> 9306m
<s> here never was such an overturn in this world
<s> each of these six men was as though he had been struck
<s> but with silver the blow passed almost instantly
<s> every thought of his soul had been set full stretch like a racer on that money well he was brought up in a single second dead and he kept his head found his temper and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment
<s> jim he whispered take that and stand by for trouble
<s> and he passed me a double barrelled pistol
<s> at the same time he began quietly moving northward and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five
<s> then he looked at me and nodded as much as to say here is a narrow corner as indeed i thought it was
<s> his looks were not quite friendly and i was so revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering so you ve changed sides again
<s> there was no time left for him to answer in
<s> the buccaneers with oaths and cries began to leap one after another into the pit and to dig with their fingers throwing the boards aside as they did so
<s> morgan found a piece of gold
<s> he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths
<s> it was a two guinea piece and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute
<s> two guineas roared merry shaking it at silver
<s> that s your seven hundred thousand pounds is it you re the man for bargains ain t you you re him that never bungled nothing you wooden headed lubber
<s> dig away boys said silver with the coolest insolence you ll find some pig nuts and i shouldn t wonder
<s> pig nuts repeated merry in a scream
<s> mates do you hear that i tell you now that man there knew it all along
<s> look in the face of him and you ll see it wrote there
<s> ah merry remarked silver standing for cap n again you re a pushing lad to be sure
<s> but this time everyone was entirely in merry s favour
<s> they began to scramble out of the excavation darting furious glances behind them
<s> one thing i observed which looked well for us they all got out upon the opposite side from silver
<s> well there we stood two on one side five on the other the pit between us and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow
<s> silver never moved he watched them very upright on his crutch and looked as cool as ever i saw him
<s> he was brave and no mistake
<s> at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters
<s> mates says he there s two of them alone there one s the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this the other s that cub that i mean to have the heart of
<s> now mates
<s> he was raising his arm and his voice and plainly meant to lead a charge
<s> but just then crack crack crack three musket shots flashed out of the thicket
<s> merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side where he lay dead but still twitching and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might
<s> 0309m
<s> before you could wink long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling merry and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony george said he i reckon i settled you
<s> at the same moment the doctor gray and ben gunn joined us with smoking muskets from among the nutmeg trees
<s> forward cried the doctor
<s> double quick my lads
<s> we must head em off the boats
<s> and we set off at a great pace sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest
<s> i tell you but silver was anxious to keep up with us
<s> the work that man went through leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst was work no sound man ever equalled and so thinks the doctor
<s> as it was he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope
<s> doctor he hailed see there no hurry
<s> sure enough there was no hurry
<s> in a more open part of the plateau we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started right for mizzenmast hill
<s> we were already between them and the boats and so we four sat down to breathe while long john mopping his face came slowly up with us
<s> thank ye kindly doctor says he
<s> you came in in about the nick i guess for me and hawkins
<s> and so it s you ben gunn he added
<s> well you re a nice one to be sure
<s> i m ben gunn i am replied the maroon wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment
<s> and he added after a long pause how do mr
<s> silver pretty well i thank ye says you
<s> ben ben murmured silver to think as you ve done me
<s> the doctor sent back gray for one of the pick axes deserted in their flight by the mutineers and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying related in a few words what had taken place
<s> it was a story that profoundly interested silver and ben gunn the half idiot maroon was the hero from beginning to end
<s> ben in his long lonely wanderings about the island had found the skeleton it was he that had rifled it he had found the treasure he had dug it up it was the haft of his pick axe that lay broken in the excavation he had carried it on his back in many weary journeys from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two pointed hill at the north east angle of the island and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the hispaniola
<s> when the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted he had gone to silver given him the chart which was now useless given him the stores for ben gunn s cave was well supplied with goats meat salted by himself given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two pointed hill there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money
<s> as for you jim he said it went against my heart but i did what i thought best for those who had stood by their duty and if you were not one of these whose fault was it
<s> that morning finding that i was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers he had run all the way to the cave and leaving the squire to guard the captain had taken gray and the maroon and started making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine
<s> soon however he saw that our party had the start of him and ben gunn being fleet of foot had been dispatched in front to do his best alone
<s> then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates and he was so far successful that gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasure hunters
<s> ah said silver it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here
<s> you would have let old john be cut to bits and never given it a thought doctor
<s> not a thought replied dr
<s> livesey cheerily
<s> and by this time we had reached the gigs
<s> the doctor with the pick axe demolished one of them and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for north inlet
<s> this was a run of eight or nine miles
<s> silver though he was almost killed already with fatigue was set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea
<s> soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the south east corner of the island round which four days ago we had towed the hispaniola
<s> as we passed the two pointed hill we could see the black mouth of ben gunn s cave and a figure standing by it leaning on a musket
<s> it was the squire and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers in which the voice of silver joined as heartily as any
<s> three miles farther just inside the mouth of north inlet what should we meet but the hispaniola cruising by herself the last flood had lifted her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help
<s> as it was there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the main sail
<s> another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water
<s> we all pulled round again to rum cove the nearest point for ben gunn s treasure house and then gray single handed returned with the gig to the hispaniola where he was to pass the night on guard
<s> a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave
<s> at the top the squire met us
<s> to me he was cordial and kind saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise
<s> at silver s polite salute he somewhat flushed
<s> john silver he said you re a prodigious villain and imposter a monstrous imposter sir
<s> i am told i am not to prosecute you
<s> well then i will not
<s> but the dead men sir hang about your neck like mill stones
<s> thank you kindly sir replied long john again saluting
<s> i dare you to thank me cried the squire
<s> it is a gross dereliction of my duty
<s> stand back
<s> and thereupon we all entered the cave
<s> it was a large airy place with a little spring and a pool of clear water overhung with ferns
<s> the floor was sand
<s> before a big fire lay captain smollett and in a far corner only duskily flickered over by the blaze i beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold
<s> that was flint s treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola
<s> how many it had cost in the amassing what blood and sorrow what good ships scuttled on the deep what brave men walking the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and lies and cruelty perhaps no man alive could tell
<s> yet there were still three upon that island silver and old morgan and ben gunn who had each taken his share in these crimes as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward
<s> come in jim said the captain
<s> you re a good boy in your line jim but i don t think you and me ll go to sea again
<s> you re too much of the born favourite for me
<s> is that you john silver what brings you here man
<s> come back to my dooty sir returned silver
<s> ah said the captain and that was all he said
<s> what a supper i had of it that night with all my friends around me and what a meal it was with ben gunn s salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola
<s> never i am sure were people gayer or happier
<s> and there was silver sitting back almost out of the firelight but eating heartily prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted even joining quietly in our laughter the same bland polite obsequious seaman of the voyage out
<s> 34
<s> 0314m
<s> and last
<s> 9314m
<s> he next morning we fell early to work for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach and thence three miles by boat to the hispaniola was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen
<s> the three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting
<s> therefore the work was pushed on briskly
<s> gray and ben gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach
<s> two of the bars slung in a rope s end made a good load for a grown man one that he was glad to walk slowly with
<s> for my part as i was not much use at carrying i was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into bread bags
<s> 0317m
<s> it was a strange collection like billy bones s hoard for the diversity of coinage but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i never had more pleasure than in sorting them
<s> english french spanish portuguese georges and louises doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins the pictures of all the kings of europe for the last hundred years strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider s web round pieces and square pieces and pieces bored through the middle as if to wear them round your neck nearly every variety of money in the world must i think have found a place in that collection and for number i am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out
<s> day after day this work went on by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers
<s> at last i think it was on the third night the doctor and i were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle when from out the thick darkness below the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing
<s> it was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence
<s> heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers
<s> all drunk sir struck in the voice of silver from behind us
<s> silver i should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent
<s> indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all
<s> yet i think none treated him better than a dog unless it was ben gunn who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter i suppose i had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau
<s> accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him
<s> drunk or raving said he
<s> right you were sir replied silver and precious little odds which to you and me
<s> i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you master silver
<s> but if i were sure they were raving as i am morally certain one at least of them is down with fever i should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill
<s> ask your pardon sir you would be very wrong quoth silver
<s> you would lose your precious life and you may lay to that
<s> i m on your side now hand and glove and i shouldn t wish for to see the party weakened let alone yourself seeing as i know what i owes you
<s> but these men down there they couldn t keep their word no not supposing they wished to and what s more they couldn t believe as you could
<s> no said the doctor
<s> you re the man to keep your word we know that
<s> well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates
<s> only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting
<s> a council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the island to the huge glee i must say of ben gunn and with the strong approval of gray
<s> we left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco
<s> that was about our last doing on the island
<s> before that we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress and at last one fine morning we weighed anchor which was about all that we could manage and stood out of north inlet the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade
<s> the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for as we soon had proved
<s> for coming through the narrows we had to lie very near the southern point and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication
<s> it went to all our hearts i think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness
<s> the doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them
<s> but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for god s sake to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place
<s> at last seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot one of them i know not which it was leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over silver s head and through the main sail
<s> after that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next i looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance
<s> that was at least the end of that and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea
<s> we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet
<s> we laid her head for the nearest port in spanish america for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it
<s> it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land locked gulf and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of negroes and mexican indians and half bloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money
<s> the sight of so many good humoured faces especially the blacks the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore to pass the early part of the night
<s> here they met the captain of an english man of war fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the hispaniola
<s> ben gunn was on deck alone and as soon as we came on board he began with wonderful contortions to make us a confession
<s> silver was gone
<s> the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives which would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg had stayed aboard
<s> but this was not all
<s> the sea cook had not gone empty handed
<s> he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings
<s> i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him
<s> well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr
<s> blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort
<s> five men only of those who had sailed returned with her
<s> drink and the devil had done for the rest with a vengeance although to be sure we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about
<s> with one man of her crew alive
<s> what put to sea with seventy five
<s> all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures
<s> captain smollett is now retired from the sea
<s> gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full rigged ship married besides and the father of a family
<s> as for ben gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth
<s> then he was given a lodge to keep exactly as he had feared upon the island and he still lives a great favourite though something of a butt with the country boys and a notable singer in church on sundays and saints days
<s> of silver we have heard no more
<s> that formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life but i dare say he met his old negress and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint
<s> it is to be hoped so i suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small
<s> the bar silver and the arms still lie for all that i know where flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me
<s> oxen and wain ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island and the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint still ringing in my ears pieces of eight pieces of eight
